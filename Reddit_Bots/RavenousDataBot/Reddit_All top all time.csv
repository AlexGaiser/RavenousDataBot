An old team at reddit,"Ellen Pao resigned from reddit today by mutual agreement.  I'm delighted to announce that Steve Huffman, founder and the original reddit CEO, is returning as CEO.
 
We are thankful for Ellen’s many contributions to reddit and the technology industry generally.  She brought focus to chaos, recruited a world-class team of executives, and drove growth.  She brought a face to reddit that changed perceptions, and is a pioneer for women in the tech industry.  She will remain as an advisor to the board through the end of 2015.  I look forward to seeing the great things she does beyond that.
 
We’re very happy to have Steve back.  Product and community are the two legs of reddit, and the board was very focused on finding a candidate who excels at both (truthfully, community is harder), which Steve does.  He has the added bonus of being a founder with ten years of reddit history in his head.  Steve is rejoining Alexis, who will work alongside Steve with the new title of “cofounder”.
 
A few other points.  Mods, you are what makes reddit great.  The reddit team, now with Steve, wants to do more for you.  You deserve better moderation tools and better communication from the admins.
 
Second, redditors, you deserve clarity about what the content policy of reddit is going to be.  The team will create guidelines to both preserve the integrity of reddit and to maintain reddit as the place where the most open and honest conversations with the entire world can happen.

Third, as a redditor, I’m particularly happy that Steve is so passionate about mobile.  I’m very excited to use reddit more on my phone.
 
As a closing note, it was sickening to see some of the things redditors wrote about Ellen. [1] The reduction in compassion that happens when we’re all behind computer screens is not good for the world.  People are still people even if there is Internet between you.

If the reddit community cannot learn to balance authenticity and compassion, it may be a great website but it will never be a truly great community.  Steve’s great challenge as CEO [2] will be continuing the work Ellen started to drive this forward.
 
 
[1] Disagreements are fine.  Death threats are not, are not covered under free speech, and will continue to get offending users banned.

Ellen asked me to point out that the sweeping majority of redditors didn’t do this, and many were incredibly supportive. Although the incredible power of the Internet is the amplification of voices, unfortunately sometimes those voices are hateful.
 
[2] We were planning to run a CEO search here and talked about how Steve (who we assumed was unavailable) was the benchmark candidate—he has exactly the combination of talent and vision we were looking for.  To our delight, it turned out our hypothetical benchmark candidate is the one actually taking the job.


NOTE: I am going to let the reddit team answer questions here, and go do an AMA myself now.

An Open Letter to the Reddit Community,"After two weeks abroad, I was looking forward to returning to the U.S. this weekend, but as I got off the plane at LAX on Sunday, I wasn't sure what country I was coming back to.

President Trump’s recent executive order is not only potentially unconstitutional, but deeply un-American. We are a nation of immigrants, after all. In the tech world, we often talk about a startup’s “unfair advantage” that allows it to beat competitors. Welcoming immigrants and refugees has been our country's unfair advantage, and coming from an immigrant family has been mine as an entrepreneur.

As many of you know, I am the son of an undocumented immigrant from Germany and the great grandson of refugees who fled the Armenian Genocide.

A little over a century ago, a Turkish soldier decided my great grandfather was too young to kill after cutting down his parents in front of him; instead of turning the sword on the boy, the soldier sent him to an orphanage. Many Armenians, including my great grandmother, found sanctuary in Aleppo, Syria—before the two reconnected and found their way to Ellis Island. Thankfully they weren't retained, rather they found this message:

*“Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”*

My great grandfather didn’t speak much English, but he worked hard, and was able to get a job at Endicott-Johnson Shoe Company in Binghamton, NY. That was his family's golden door. And though he and my great grandmother had four children, all born in the U.S., immigration continued to reshape their family, generation after generation. The one son they had—my grandfather [(here’s his AMA)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29039l/iam_john_ohanian_92_year_old_lawyer_parttime/)—volunteered to serve in the Second World War and married a French-Armenian immigrant. And my mother, a native of Hamburg, Germany, decided to leave her friends, family, and education behind after falling in love with my father, who was born in San Francisco.

She got a student visa, came to the U.S. and then worked as an au pair, uprooting her entire life for love in a foreign land. She overstayed her visa. She should have left, but she didn't. After she and my father married, she received a green card, which she kept for over a decade until she became a citizen. I grew up speaking German, but she insisted I focus on my English in order to be successful. She eventually got her citizenship and I’ll never forget her swearing in ceremony.

If you’ve never seen people taking the pledge of allegiance for the first time as U.S. Citizens, it will move you: a room full of people who can really appreciate what I was lucky enough to grow up with, simply by being born in Brooklyn. It thrills me to write reference letters for enterprising founders who are looking to get visas to start their companies here, to create value and jobs for these United States.

My forebears were brave refugees who found a home in this country. I’ve always been proud to live in a country that said yes to these shell-shocked immigrants from a strange land, that created a path for a woman who wanted only to work hard and start a family here. 

Without them, there’s no me, and there’s no Reddit. We are Americans. Let’s not forget that we’ve thrived as a nation because we’ve been a beacon for the courageous—the tired, the poor, the tempest-tossed.

Right now, Lady Liberty’s lamp is dimming, which is why it's more important than ever that we speak out and show up to support all those for whom it shines—past, present, and future. I ask you to do this however you see fit, whether it's calling your representative (this works, it's how we defeated SOPA + PIPA), marching in protest, [donating to the ACLU](https://action.aclu.org/secure/donate-to-aclu), or voting, of course, and not just for Presidential elections.

Our platform, like our country, thrives the more people and communities we have within it. Reddit, Inc. will continue to welcome all citizens of the world to our digital community and our office.

—Alexis

My dad, his brother, and their niece came here together, and I'm not sure if my mom had anyone with her. They don't talk about those times much, but I do know that my dad's boat encountered pirates on the way and had all of their lives threatened for what little valuables they had managed to smuggle out. They all came here not k owing any English, but managed to scrape together enough to cobble a meager living and to be able to bring their families over to safety. They continued to work so hard to be able to provide, to be able to go to school and earn their Bachelor's, and eventually when I came along, to give me a better future. My mom attended night school so she could keep her jobs and had to bring me along to class sometimes because they couldn't afford a babysitter and everyone else was working. They took me out to have fried chicken for my birthday one year because eating out was a luxury. They worked so goddamned hard. So goddamned fucking hard. Now, they're full-fledged citizens who pay taxes and vote. ",CA[deleted],280,08:54.1

So, I say, 'Okay, I'll bite. Why?'
And he says, 'Because... there's no underwear in space.'
I promise you thi is true, and he says it with such conviction too! Like he ahd been to space and looked around and he didn't see any bras or panties or briefs anywhere.
Now, George came to my show when it was in Berkeley. He came backstage and explained why you can't wear your brassiere in other galaxies, and I have a sense you will be going to outer space very soon, so here's why you cannot wear your brassiere, per George. So, what happens is you go to space and you become weightless. So far so good, right? But then your body expands??? But your bra doesn't- so you get strangled by your own bra. Now I think that this would make a fantastic obit- so I tell my younger friends that no matter how I go, I want it reported that I drowned in moonlight, strangled by my own bra.

The problem is the system itself.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I served in the U.S. Navy for 5 years and during that time frame I've seen a lot of people come and go because of underage drinking, adultery, drugs, and bad behavior. One thing that I've seen only once was due to mental health.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not sure if this only applies to the fast attack submarine force but this is why suicides happen. Note: fast attack submarines only had men on board during the time I served.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine that you you're feeling down recently and no matter what you do you can't seem to shrug off this underwelming feeling seems to be taking over your life. You're not eating much anymore, you're beginning to drink alcohol excessively, and you're beginning to demonstrate poor performance at work by constantly showing up late or half assing your job. Eventually you think that you might be depresssed. You go to the doctor of your submarine (which is not an actual doctor that went to medical school but instead a person who is taught to handle more simple issues like cuts and distributing antibiotics) which is a corpmen. He tells you that you're just feeling down and that you shouldn't worry about it and the feeling will go away. You trust the doc since he's the most knowledgeable person on board and you just wait it out.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few weeks go by and you realize that the feeling of being alone just isn't going away. You tell Doc again and he gives you the same answer. This time you decide that it will be best if you go to Mental Health and see an actual doc because you know this empty feeling is more than just a phase. You eventually go to mental health and talk to a doctor that wants to see you three times a week to talk about your issue. You are actively seeking help so although you feel like its impossible to shake away this feeling, you are still doing something to try and make things better. But it doesnt get better, because you get back to the boat.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment you get back to the boat and you tell the Doc that you went to Mental Health, everything changes. Doc gets upset at you for going to see a doctor outside of him. He eventually tell's the chief of the boat (think of an executive position of a company but in charge of enlisted personnel) and eventually the rest of the chiefs (divisional supervisors) hear about it too. One would assume that they would be supportive of your action, but they arent. They are the complete opposite. They are beginning to look at you funny, they are making off handed negative remarks about you, and some of them even goes up to you and ask if you're just faking it to get off the submarine. These are your supervisors, the people that you are supposed to look up to for guidance and now they are looking at you like you're the worst person to ever step foot on the submarine. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the alienation doesn't end there. Word gets out to the rest of your crew members (E6 and below/ other team members) and they begin to verbally harass you. They start calling you a bitch because they think you are just trying to scam out of work, they start laughing at you while you walk by because a person can't be mentally weak while in a submarine, they start putting you down in front of the rest of the crew because you are now the odd person out. These are the guys that you work with every single day of your enlisted career. These are the same guys that you went on a deployment for months at a time underwater without seeing sunlight or constant email from loved ones. These are the same guys that you would party with when you pull into port and the same guys you would cry to when your girlfriend cheats on you while youre on deployment. These are your family. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, your loneliest exasperated because the people that you once trusted so much are ostracizing you because they think you are lazy and just trying to get off of work. What do you do now? You see these guys every day for work while in port and are stuck with them 24 hours a day while deployed. You're constantly around a culture that puts you down every second of everyday. You're not only feeling alone, you are completely alone. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So one day, you're standing watch at 1 A.M. with one other person in port. You looked down at your holster and stare at your 9MM pistol. You start feeling like life no longer has meaning and that you have no one, you have nothing to live for, and no one will care if you are gone. You pick up the 9MM pistol, turn the barrel until it's facing you, and you pull the trigger.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having more suicide prevention seminars will not stop the problem, we need to stop the culture that demonizes a person who is seeking help.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is the link to the most recent submarine sailor that took his own life. This shit needs to stop.

I was standing around backstage while the room was being filled, checking in on our VIPs when Carrie came in with her crew. I knew one of her guest escorts so I said hi to him. He introduced me to Carrie and I told her how wonderful it was to meet her. She shook my hand and looked intently at my face. Then she pulled out a make-up case and a brush and started brushing something on to the left side of my face. I looked at Fritz, her escort, and he said, ""She's been doing this all day."" Carrie grabbed my chin and turned my face back to her. She then finished COVERING the left side of my face with glitter, cocked her head to take a more critical view of her work, nodded, and went on to her next appearance. She never spoke to me the entire time but booped my nose as she walked away.

I kept running into other people on the crew that day who had glitter dust on their faces. Everyone just smiled and said, ""Oh, you ran in to Carrie, too.""

Super nice lady. She will definitely be missed.

EDIT: Wow, my first Reddit Gold just for telling a cute little encounter. I just thought sharing that story might make a few people smile.
