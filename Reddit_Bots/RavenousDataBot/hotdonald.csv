MAGAthread Watch Party: The Confirmation Vote of Judge Brett Kavanaugh,"***

##**GOOD AFTERNOON PATRIOTS!** 

[ARE YOU GUYS READY FOR MORE WINNING!?](http://magaimg.net/img/6db7.gif)


***

**The final Senate vote on Judge Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court is expected to take place later on today (between 3-5 PM ET)**. - Could potentially be a lot sooner, around 3:30 PM (see updates below for more details!!)

Yesterday, The Senate voted 51-49 to limit debate on the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court. Senators Flake, Collins, and Manchin voted in favor of the motion. Senator Murkowski voted against it.

We'll have all your updates and livestreams right here on r/The_Donald! There will of course be an overload of salt and **REEEEEEE**ing so don't forget to do a little mining while we wait for our new SCOTUS!

Dems also attacked Repubs for only having 5 minutes to ask questions, when the reality is they DEMANDED 5 minutes each.

So they got everything they wanted, and they're still not happy because things didn't go their way.

They're probably realizing that it was stupid AF to ask for a 1 week investigation, expecting republicans to ignore it, so they can attack republicans with ""See, they can't even give us a 1 week investigation!  They're afraid of what we will find in a short investigation!"".

> I felt increasingly alienated"" from the abortion rights movement, McCorvey wrote in a second memoir, ""Won By Love,"" in 1997.
Her doubts about Roe vs. Wade were tested when a leading anti-abortion group opened an office in the same strip mall as the clinic where she worked. At first, McCorvey exchanged snide remarks with abortion opponents and nicknamed their national president, the Rev. Philip Benham, ""Flipper.""
Eventually, she and Benham began to talk. He baptized her in a Dallas swimming pool in August 1995, a religious conversion that made national news. Months later, she told the Washington Times that her relationship with Gonzalez had become platonic.
""I am not a lesbian. I'm just a child in Christ now,"" she said.
McCorvey quit her job at the clinic, joined Benham and formed a speakers' bureau named ""Roe No More."" She later burned the Supreme Court decision that bore her name at a protest in a church parking lot, and tore it up outside the Mississippi state Capitol.
""_She spent the better part of the last 25 years working to undo the terrible Supreme Court decision that bears her name,"" said Troy Newman, president of Operation Rescue, who described her as a longtime friend. He added in an interview, ""As Christians, we understand that God allows you U-turns.""_
Abortion rights attorney Gloria Allred, who represented McCorvey before her religious conversion, called her ""a very complicated person"" who had continued to speak warmly with Allred throughout her life.
In her later years, McCorvey gradually drifted back to ""normal person"" status. But she was confident that her unusual story would be remembered. ""I do not fit many people's idea of a historical role model,"" she said.

She also never had an abortion. She gave birth to three children from three separate fathers. All of the children were adopted by other families as soon as they were born. ",CA[deleted],139,2018-10-05 12:06:00

Under general legal principles, an assault is a physical act or a show of force that puts another person in fear of imminent harm or offensive physical contact.

""Rifts Break Open at Facebook Over Kavanaugh Hearing

The apology came from Joel Kaplan, Facebook’s vice president for global public policy. A day earlier, Mr. Kaplan had sat behind his friend, Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trump’s nominee for the Supreme Court, when the judge testified in Congress about allegations he had sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford in high school. Mr. Kaplan’s surprise appearance prompted anger and shock among many Facebook employees, some of whom said they took his action as a tacit show of support for Judge Kavanaugh — as if it were an endorsement from Facebook itself.

The unrest quickly spilled over onto Facebook’s internal message boards, where hundreds of workers have since posted about their concerns, according to current and former employees. To quell the hubbub, Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, last Friday explained in a widely attended staff meeting that Mr. Kaplan was a close friend of Judge Kavanaugh’s and had broken no company rules, these people said.

Yet the disquiet within the company has not subsided. This week, Facebook employees kept flooding internal forums with comments about Mr. Kaplan’s appearance at the hearing. In a post on Wednesday, Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook executive, appeared to dismiss the concerns when he wrote to employees that “it is your responsibility to choose a path, not that of the company you work for.” Facebook plans to hold another staff meeting on Friday to contain the damage, said the current and former employees.""

"My friend in HR says when you see people with degrees in Grievance Studies, that it is a HUGE RED FLAG used to avoid hiring those who cause the most amount of grief in the workplace.","

Degrees in complaining (Grievance Studies) are bestowed upon the Nation's Most Prolific Whiners.

* Women's studies 
* Gender studies
* Race studies

My friend in my HR dept says she receives complaints from these whiners more than anyone else and it's usually normal activity that the complainant twists into some perceived offence.

Ever notice none of these ""Studies"" degrees are Sciences? Why? **( **HINT:  You can earn a degree in Computer Science, not Computer Studies.)**

What would a degree in Gender Science look like?  It would take 5 minutes to earn because science says there are 2 genders and some people with a debilitating mental birth defect.

Anyway - she tells me that if you see a useless ""X Studies"" degree on the resume, then you have found a Professional Umbrage Taker, and you should immediately send it to File 13 if you want harmony in the workplace.",246,2018-10-05 17:42:17,The_Donald,gloxon,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/9lnxeu/my_friend_in_hr_says_when_you_see_people_with/,/r/The_Donald/comments/9lnxeu/my_friend_in_hr_says_when_you_see_people_with/,9lnxeu,"Just hire people with real degrees, it's pretty easy.",CA[deleted],22,2018-10-05 12:08:46

This is the *only reason* they want to delay confirmation. As long as he doesn't get confirmed tomorrow, he can't rule on it and it potentially goes 4-4.  Trump will just choose another conservative justice, but the ruling will have already been made.

SPEZ: Should also note that in a tie, the Ninth Circus ruling would stand, which says ICE must *immediately* take custody of released detainees or they are allowed to go free. This is how the sanctuary city loophole works.  They release a prisoner and if ICE isn't standing there to get them, they are allowed to walk even if ICE has filed a detainer.",CA[deleted],11,2018-10-05 13:37:57

Reddit censoring T_D on front page,"I've been noticing T_D posts making it to the front page of r/all and wasn't really surprised considering the 2018 election, Kavanaugh vote, and seeing 20k+ winners online at all times. But I was a little suspicious seeing a Trump tweet at #11 on the front page today, so I decided to open the page in Incognito mode to double check, and sure enough the post wasn't there.

It seems like Reddit is showing T_D posts in the top of r/all for members only and censoring them out for everyone else. No surprise really, but this kind of thing is so slimy.. They love making money from us (we are #3 on reddit by activity) but can't stand our opinions and values (liberty, justice, prosperity, due process, etc.) so they do anything they can to silence us while still benefiting from the massive traffic we bring them.

"Secret Trump supporter, lifetime democrat. Voting republican in the mid-terms for the first time after the Kavanaugh disgrace.","Hey TD.

Full disclosure, last election I voted for Gary Johnson, and before that I voted 2x for Obama.

I live in the great (swing) state of Michigan and come from a long line of pro-union automotive and construction workers. In my family we voted democrat to protect unions, and that was just the way it was. 

Then the democrats stopped pretending to care about people like us.

When I was a kid, my grandparents had always talked about Trump in a positive way. When I went to the beach and wanted money for ice cream, they would joke, *“Who do you think I am, Donald Trump?”*.

I remember seeing him doing interviews with Larry King and Phil Donahue when I was a little kid, and he was always positive and always talked about a better future for America.

The Kavanaugh hearing and rape accusations finally pushed us all solid right. I called my dad to talk about it and he was already disgusted. He has 3 sons, he knew that could have been me up there.

I’ve been a secret Trump supporter over the last year or so, and some of my comments have been linked here for dropping truth bombs on the rest of reddit. That’s over, because I was recently banned from r.news and r.politics for saying some *inconvenient facts*.

Michigan loves Trump, and we are behind him the whole way. I have more hope for this state than I ever have, but only if we get out there and continue to make it happen.

Trump taught me how to handle my abusive ex-husband.,"I was in a terrible and abusive marriage and after I divorced he continued to constantly attack me through custody battles and harassment. He basically treated me like the media treats Trump. Constant blame and accusations. I can never do anything right. I am blamed for absolutely everything  under the sun even though he is abusing me and my child. He is a victim and I am a monster. 

For years I tried to reason with him, defend myself with the truth and do what is decent and right. It never ever worked. 

During the election campaign I kept watching the Trump rallies and the speeches he gave. I saw how he handled the media accusations and the attacks of his adversaries. I saw how they accused him of everything they did. He didn’t defend himself. He told the TRUTH and never tried to appease them. 

I couldn’t get enough of seeing him stand up to the intimidation tactics and not giving in. In fact whenever he was attacked he attacked back HARD. “Not only are we gonna build the wall, but now it’s gonna be ten feet taller! And Mexico is going to pay for it!!”

It was unprecedented! It started to change me! I started using the same tactics! You want to accuse me and lie about me and attack my character??!  I don’t care. I will attack and punish you. 

You want to intimidate me? I will come at you without fear but with an attack you won’t recover from. I finally stood up to the bully and GUESS WHAT!!! 

It worked!!! He turned out to be a big fat “grab em by the p^$$¥!!”

After 14 years of HELL my ex has basically disappeared from our lives! He is no longer around and I have barely heard from in in almost a year!!

His epic [BTFO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKSRUK-l7dM) of the Democratic ""Senators"" was on the level of ""You'd be in jail"". After hearing that smackdown I had an immediate overpowering impulse to go to my fridge and shotgun a beer in honor of Judge Kavanaugh. Truly some powerful stuff folks. Then Kanye, Yeezy himself, BTFO'd Democrats on their home turf on SNL. Keenan Thompson was so butthurt that he bitched about not being able to criticize Trump and disagree...on SNL. I suppose since no one watches SNL anymore (Sad!) he thought it was the equivalent of being deplatformed? Steven Crowder (Who is having an AMA on your favorite domreddit, Tuesday at 6PM EST) [revealed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6dv6G1FWxk) that TCU actually stands for ""Triggered Cuck University"" and actually made them [admit](https://i.redd.it/jgtwpeny26q11.png) that they think *their own campus* has a rape problem. Next up, Boss Turntle (the namesake of this edition of MMF) himself Mitch McConnell. Clearly he's doing something right, since the [Fake](http://archive.is/dips2) [News](http://archive.is/RPI6s) [Media](http://archive.is/AW8bx) has once again started writing hitpieces on our reptilian majority leader.

"Secret Trump supporter, lifetime democrat. Voting republican in the mid-terms for the first time after the Kavanaugh disgrace.","Hey TD.

Full disclosure, last election I voted for Gary Johnson, and before that I voted 2x for Obama.

I live in the great (swing) state of Michigan and come from a long line of pro-union automotive and construction workers. In my family we voted democrat to protect unions, and that was just the way it was. 

Then the democrats stopped pretending to care about people like us.

When I was a kid, my grandparents had always talked about Trump in a positive way. When I went to the beach and wanted money for ice cream, they would joke, *“Who do you think I am, Donald Trump?”*.

I remember seeing him doing interviews with Larry King and Phil Donahue when I was a little kid, and he was always positive and always talked about a better future for America.

The Kavanaugh hearing and rape accusations finally pushed us all solid right. I called my dad to talk about it and he was already disgusted. He has 3 sons, he knew that could have been *me* up there.

I’ve been a secret Trump supporter over the last year or so, and some of my comments have been linked here for dropping truth bombs on the rest of reddit. That’s over, because I was recently banned from r.news and r.politics for saying some *inconvenient facts*.

Michigan loves Trump, and we are behind him the whole way. I have more hope for this state than I ever have, but only if we get out there and continue to make it happen.

**MAGA**

_________________

*Cloture on a presidential nomination requires a simple majority of those present and voting. This was changed for all presidential appointments other than Supreme Court nominees in a November 21, 2013**^ThanksHarryReid**, Senate vote (the so-called ""nuclear option""), and was further extended to include Supreme Court nominees in an April 6, 2017, Senate vote.*

_________________

**After cloture has been invoked, the following restrictions apply:**

*  No more than 30 additional hours of debate may occur on the bill in question[36] (though this additional time is commonly shortened or vitiated altogether).

*  No Senator may speak for more than one hour.

*  No amendments may be moved unless they were filed on the day between the presentation of the petition and the actual cloture vote.

*  All amendments must be relevant to the debate.

*  Certain procedural motions are not permissible.

*  The presiding officer gains additional powers in controlling debate such as the power to count to determine whether a quorum is present and to rule amendments, motions, and other actions out of order on the grounds that they are dilatory.


*  No other matters may be considered until the question upon which cloture was invoked is resolved.

Trump taught me how to handle my abusive ex-husband.,"I was in a terrible and abusive marriage and after I divorced he continued to constantly attack me through custody battles and harassment. He basically treated me like the media treats Trump. Constant blame and accusations. I can never do anything right. I am blamed for absolutely everything  under the sun even though he is abusing me and my child. He is a victim and I am a monster. 

For years I tried to reason with him, defend myself with the truth and do what is decent and right. It never ever worked. 

During the election campaign I kept watching the Trump rallies and the speeches he gave. I saw how he handled the media accusations and the attacks of his adversaries. I saw how they accused him of everything they did. He didn’t defend himself. He told the TRUTH and never tried to appease them. 

I couldn’t get enough of seeing him stand up to the intimidation tactics and not giving in. In fact whenever he was attacked he attacked back HARD. “Not only are we gonna build the wall, but now it’s gonna be ten feet taller! And Mexico is going to pay for it!!”

It was unprecedented! It started to change me! I started using the same tactics! You want to accuse me and lie about me and attack my character??!  I don’t care. I will attack and punish you. 

You want to intimidate me? I will come at you without fear but with an attack you won’t recover from. I finally stood up to the bully and GUESS WHAT!!! 

It worked!!! He turned out to be a big fat “grab em by the p^$$¥!!”

After 14 years of HELL my ex has basically disappeared from our lives! He is no longer around and I have barely heard from in in almost a year!!

Dems also attacked Repubs for only having 5 minutes to ask questions, when the reality is they DEMANDED 5 minutes each.

So they got everything they wanted, and they're still not happy because things didn't go their way.

They're probably realizing that it was stupid AF to ask for a 1 week investigation, expecting republicans to ignore it, so they can attack republicans with ""See, they can't even give us a 1 week investigation!  They're afraid of what we will find in a short investigation!"".

> I felt increasingly alienated"" from the abortion rights movement, McCorvey wrote in a second memoir, ""Won By Love,"" in 1997.
Her doubts about Roe vs. Wade were tested when a leading anti-abortion group opened an office in the same strip mall as the clinic where she worked. At first, McCorvey exchanged snide remarks with abortion opponents and nicknamed their national president, the Rev. Philip Benham, ""Flipper.""
Eventually, she and Benham began to talk. He baptized her in a Dallas swimming pool in August 1995, a religious conversion that made national news. Months later, she told the Washington Times that her relationship with Gonzalez had become platonic.
""I am not a lesbian. I'm just a child in Christ now,"" she said.
McCorvey quit her job at the clinic, joined Benham and formed a speakers' bureau named ""Roe No More."" She later burned the Supreme Court decision that bore her name at a protest in a church parking lot, and tore it up outside the Mississippi state Capitol.
""_She spent the better part of the last 25 years working to undo the terrible Supreme Court decision that bears her name,"" said Troy Newman, president of Operation Rescue, who described her as a longtime friend. He added in an interview, ""As Christians, we understand that God allows you U-turns.""_
Abortion rights attorney Gloria Allred, who represented McCorvey before her religious conversion, called her ""a very complicated person"" who had continued to speak warmly with Allred throughout her life.
In her later years, McCorvey gradually drifted back to ""normal person"" status. But she was confident that her unusual story would be remembered. ""I do not fit many people's idea of a historical role model,"" she said.

She also never had an abortion. She gave birth to three children from three separate fathers. All of the children were adopted by other families as soon as they were born. ",CA[deleted],173,2018-10-05 21:06:21

Under general legal principles, an assault is a physical act or a show of force that puts another person in fear of imminent harm or offensive physical contact.

She used massively inflated and categorically false numbers to justify the proposed cut, also saying that ""it'll be easier to hire civilians.""  Yeah, that's bullshit.  Civilian musicians and production companies constantly oversell or over-promise their capabilities, they score a contract, show up (usually hours late and turn the setup into a rushed clusterfuck), and deliver a mediocre product.

With military musicians, you get physically fit, fully capable and deployable service members who can lead ceremonies, entertain the troops or support international diplomacy efforts.  More than half the field has BA's.  A good amount have MA's, and each band usually has, on average, a few PhD's.  We typically shoot lights out at the range and have more than our fair share of Airborne/Air Assault wings and other accolades.  Our E6's would be E8's or higher in other jobs.

She made absolutely zero effort to engage with any military musicians or subject matter experts before proposing these massive cuts.  Having been a part of closing down two active duty bands within the last two and a half years in very pro-military communities who collectively were not happy, it fucking sucked.  Soldiers, civilians and veterans were legitimately sad to see those bands get deactivated.  Maybe they'll get a reserve band once or twice a year, but that's it.

""Rifts Break Open at Facebook Over Kavanaugh Hearing

The apology came from Joel Kaplan, Facebook’s vice president for global public policy. A day earlier, Mr. Kaplan had sat behind his friend, Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trump’s nominee for the Supreme Court, when the judge testified in Congress about allegations he had sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford in high school. Mr. Kaplan’s surprise appearance prompted anger and shock among many Facebook employees, some of whom said they took his action as a tacit show of support for Judge Kavanaugh — as if it were an endorsement from Facebook itself.

The unrest quickly spilled over onto Facebook’s internal message boards, where hundreds of workers have since posted about their concerns, according to current and former employees. To quell the hubbub, Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, last Friday explained in a widely attended staff meeting that Mr. Kaplan was a close friend of Judge Kavanaugh’s and had broken no company rules, these people said.

Yet the disquiet within the company has not subsided. This week, Facebook employees kept flooding internal forums with comments about Mr. Kaplan’s appearance at the hearing. In a post on Wednesday, Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook executive, appeared to dismiss the concerns when he wrote to employees that “it is your responsibility to choose a path, not that of the company you work for.” Facebook plans to hold another staff meeting on Friday to contain the damage, said the current and former employees.""

I love you guys.,"Back in 2016, when I was Pro-Hillary and Anti-Trump, I believed the media when it came to to supporters of Donald Trump being racist, sexist, homophobic, etc. When I made the switch from Democrat to Republican, I learned that supporters of Donald Trump are some of those most tolerant people I have ever met. You all value the freedom of speech, religion, individual liberty, etc. I feel at home and I seriously love the fact that we beat the establishment against all odds. POTUS's win caused me to start studying and appreciating the Constitution for all of it's glory and worth. I honestly cannot wait to raise my right hand and swear the sacred Oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States of America when I swear-in with the Army. After that, I plan on studying political science and Constitutional Law. I cannot wait to run for office someday and pledge to unite this country like never before. I love you guys. I cannot wait to vote Republican on November 6th, 2018 and continue to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.

Daily Bible Scripture: Daniel 6:19-23,"[Daniel 6:19-23 ESV] Then, at break of day, the king arose and went in haste to the den of lions. As he came near to the den where Daniel was, he cried out in a tone of anguish. The king declared to Daniel, “O Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to deliver you from the lions?” 

Then Daniel said to the king, “O king, live forever! My God sent his angel and shut the lions’ mouths, and they have not harmed me, because I was found blameless before him; and also before you, O king, I have done no harm.” Then the king was exceedingly glad, and commanded that Daniel be taken up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no kind of harm was found on him, because he had trusted in his God.

MAGAthread Watch Party: The Confirmation Vote of Judge Brett Kavanaugh,"***

##**GOOD AFTERNOON PATRIOTS!** 

[ARE YOU GUYS READY FOR MORE WINNING!?](http://magaimg.net/img/6db7.gif)


***

**The final Senate vote on Judge Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court is expected to take place later on today (between 3-5 PM ET)**. - Could potentially be a lot sooner, around 3:30 PM (see updates below for more details!!)

Yesterday, The Senate voted 51-49 to limit debate on the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court. Senators Flake, Collins, and Manchin voted in favor of the motion. Senator Murkowski voted against it.

We'll have all your updates and livestreams right here on r/The_Donald! There will of course be an overload of salt and **REEEEEEE**ing so don't forget to do a little mining while we wait for our new SCOTUS!

MAGAthread Watch Party: The Confirmation Vote of Judge Brett Kavanaugh,"***

##**GOOD AFTERNOON PATRIOTS!** 

[ARE YOU GUYS READY FOR MORE WINNING!?](http://magaimg.net/img/6db7.gif)


***

**The final Senate vote on Judge Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court is expected to take place later on today (between 3-5 PM ET)**. - Could potentially be a lot sooner, around 3:30 PM (see updates below for more details!!)

Yesterday, The Senate voted 51-49 to limit debate on the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court. Senators Flake, Collins, and Manchin voted in favor of the motion. Senator Murkowski voted against it.

We'll have all your updates and livestreams right here on r/The_Donald! There will of course be an overload of salt and **REEEEEEE**ing so don't forget to do a little mining while we wait for our new SCOTUS!

MAGAthread Watch Party: The Confirmation Vote of Judge Brett Kavanaugh,"***

##**GOOD AFTERNOON PATRIOTS!** 

[ARE YOU GUYS READY FOR MORE WINNING!?](http://magaimg.net/img/6db7.gif)


***

**The final Senate vote on Judge Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court is expected to take place later on today (between 3-5 PM ET)**. - Could potentially be a lot sooner, around 3:30 PM (see updates below for more details!!)

Yesterday, The Senate voted 51-49 to limit debate on the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court. Senators Flake, Collins, and Manchin voted in favor of the motion. Senator Murkowski voted against it.

We'll have all your updates and livestreams right here on r/The_Donald! There will of course be an overload of salt and **REEEEEEE**ing so don't forget to do a little mining while we wait for our new SCOTUS!

Daily Bible Scripture: Daniel 6:19-23,"[Daniel 6:19-23 ESV] Then, at break of day, the king arose and went in haste to the den of lions. As he came near to the den where Daniel was, he cried out in a tone of anguish. The king declared to Daniel, “O Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to deliver you from the lions?” 

Then Daniel said to the king, “O king, live forever! My God sent his angel and shut the lions’ mouths, and they have not harmed me, because I was found blameless before him; and also before you, O king, I have done no harm.” Then the king was exceedingly glad, and commanded that Daniel be taken up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no kind of harm was found on him, because he had trusted in his God.

Pro self-defence laws are on the way.

"Secret Trump supporter, lifetime democrat. Voting republican in the mid-terms for the first time after the Kavanaugh disgrace.","Hey TD.

Full disclosure, last election I voted for Gary Johnson, and before that I voted 2x for Obama.

I live in the great (swing) state of Michigan and come from a long line of pro-union automotive and construction workers. In my family we voted democrat to protect unions, and that was just the way it was. 

Then the democrats stopped pretending to care about people like us.

When I was a kid, my grandparents had always talked about Trump in a positive way. When I went to the beach and wanted money for ice cream, they would joke, *“Who do you think I am, Donald Trump?”*.

I remember seeing him doing interviews with Larry King and Phil Donahue when I was a little kid, and he was always positive and always talked about a better future for America.

The Kavanaugh hearing and rape accusations finally pushed us all solid right. I called my dad to talk about it and he was already disgusted. He has 3 sons, he knew that could have been *me* up there.

I’ve been a secret Trump supporter over the last year or so, and some of my comments have been linked here for dropping truth bombs on the rest of reddit. That’s over, because I was recently banned from r.news and r.politics for saying some *inconvenient facts*.

Michigan loves Trump, and we are behind him the whole way. I have more hope for this state than I ever have, but only if we get out there and continue to make it happen.

**MAGA**

MEME MAGIC FRIDAY: SLOW AND STEADY EDITION,"#GREETINGS CENTIPEDES!

**Welcome back to another Meme Magic Friday! As usual I am your host, Crusader, and humble meme farmer /u/D4rkd3str0yer.** 


**Our sponsor this week is Bold Text! Bold Text: Same great text, just higher energy. We are also sponsored this week by Beer. Not that feminist Bud Light shit, I'm talking real, American beer, Yuengling. Drank by Chadvanaughs everywhere!**

**It has been quite a few weeks! Old enemies became allies, old allies stepped up to the plate, the GEOTUS cucked Canada, and I realized that no, I am not, in fact, tired of winning (for those of you who are tired of winning, I hear /r/The_Mueller is accepting mod applications).**

**Who could have predicted the turnaround of [LINDSAY FUCKING GRAHAM](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/491453197336969225/497840830229250049/rif-1538764874448.jpg)? His epic [BTFO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKSRUK-l7dM) of the Democratic ""Senators"" was on the level of ""You'd be in jail"". After hearing that smackdown I had an immediate overpowering impulse to go to my fridge and shotgun a beer in honor of Judge Kavanaugh. Truly some powerful stuff folks. Then Kanye, Yeezy himself, BTFO'd Democrats on their home turf on SNL. Keenan Thompson was so butthurt that he bitched about not being able to criticize Trump and disagree...on SNL. I suppose since no one watches SNL anymore (Sad!) he thought it was the equivalent of being deplatformed? Steven Crowder (Who is having an AMA on your favorite domreddit, Tuesday at 6PM EST) [revealed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6dv6G1FWxk) that TCU actually stands for ""Triggered Cuck University"" and actually made them [admit](https://i.redd.it/jgtwpeny26q11.png) that they think *their own campus* has a rape problem. Next up, Boss Turntle (the namesake of this edition of MMF) himself Mitch McConnell. Clearly he's doing something right, since the [Fake](http://archive.is/dips2) [News](http://archive.is/RPI6s) [Media](http://archive.is/AW8bx) has once again started writing hitpieces on our reptilian majority leader. And finally, Senator Orrin Hatch absolutely [ended](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/9lgboz/orrin_hatch_handles_a_protester/) a group of protestors, shooing them off like the gadflies they are and telling them what their parents are thinking: ""Grow up"".**

As he came near to the den where Daniel was, he cried out in a tone of anguish. The king declared to Daniel, “O Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to deliver you from the lions?” 

Then Daniel said to the king, “O king, live forever! My God sent his angel and shut the lions’ mouths, and they have not harmed me, because I was found blameless before him; and also before you, O king, I have done no harm.” Then the king was exceedingly glad, and commanded that Daniel be taken up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no kind of harm was found on him, because he had trusted in his God.

"Secret Trump supporter, lifetime democrat. Voting republican in the mid-terms for the first time after the Kavanaugh disgrace.","Hey TD.

Full disclosure, last election I voted for Gary Johnson, and before that I voted 2x for Obama.

I live in the great (swing) state of Michigan and come from a long line of pro-union automotive and construction workers. In my family we voted democrat to protect unions, and that was just the way it was. 

Then the democrats stopped pretending to care about people like us.

When I was a kid, my grandparents had always talked about Trump in a positive way. When I went to the beach and wanted money for ice cream, they would joke, *“Who do you think I am, Donald Trump?”*.

I remember seeing him doing interviews with Larry King and Phil Donahue when I was a little kid, and he was always positive and always talked about a better future for America.

The Kavanaugh hearing and rape accusations finally pushed us all solid right. I called my dad to talk about it and he was already disgusted. He has 3 sons, he knew that could have been *me* up there.

I’ve been a secret Trump supporter over the last year or so, and some of my comments have been linked here for dropping truth bombs on the rest of reddit. That’s over, because I was recently banned from r.news and r.politics for saying some *inconvenient facts*.

Michigan loves Trump, and we are behind him the whole way. I have more hope for this state than I ever have, but only if we get out there and continue to make it happen.

**MAGA**

**Welcome back to another Meme Magic Friday! As usual I am your host, Crusader, and humble meme farmer /u/D4rkd3str0yer.** 


**Our sponsor this week is Bold Text! Bold Text: Same great text, just higher energy. We are also sponsored this week by Beer. Not that feminist Bud Light shit, I'm talking real, American beer, Yuengling. Drank by Chadvanaughs everywhere!**

**It has been quite a few weeks! Old enemies became allies, old allies stepped up to the plate, the GEOTUS cucked Canada, and I realized that no, I am not, in fact, tired of winning (for those of you who are tired of winning, I hear /r/The_Mueller is accepting mod applications).**

**Who could have predicted the turnaround of [LINDSAY FUCKING GRAHAM](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/491453197336969225/497840830229250049/rif-1538764874448.jpg)? His epic [BTFO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKSRUK-l7dM) of the Democratic ""Senators"" was on the level of ""You'd be in jail"". After hearing that smackdown I had an immediate overpowering impulse to go to my fridge and shotgun a beer in honor of Judge Kavanaugh. Truly some powerful stuff folks. Then Kanye, Yeezy himself, BTFO'd Democrats on their home turf on SNL. Keenan Thompson was so butthurt that he bitched about not being able to criticize Trump and disagree...on SNL. I suppose since no one watches SNL anymore (Sad!) he thought it was the equivalent of being deplatformed? Steven Crowder (Who is having an AMA on your favorite domreddit, Tuesday at 6PM EST) [revealed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6dv6G1FWxk) that TCU actually stands for ""Triggered Cuck University"" and actually made them [admit](https://i.redd.it/jgtwpeny26q11.png) that they think *their own campus* has a rape problem. Next up, Boss Turntle (the namesake of this edition of MMF) himself Mitch McConnell.

**The final Senate vote on Judge Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court is expected to take place later on today (between 3-5 PM ET)**. - Could potentially be a lot sooner, around 3:30 PM (see updates below for more details!!)

Daily Bible Scripture: Daniel 6:19-23,"[Daniel 6:19-23 ESV] Then, at break of day, the king arose and went in haste to the den of lions. As he came near to the den where Daniel was, he cried out in a tone of anguish. The king declared to Daniel, “O Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to deliver you from the lions?” 

Then Daniel said to the king, “O king, live forever! My God sent his angel and shut the lions’ mouths, and they have not harmed me, because I was found blameless before him; and also before you, O king, I have done no harm.” Then the king was exceedingly glad, and commanded that Daniel be taken up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no kind of harm was found on him, because he had trusted in his God.

***

**The final Senate vote on Judge Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court is expected to take place later on today (between 3-5 PM ET)**. - Could potentially be a lot sooner, around 3:30 PM (see updates below for more details!!)

"Secret Trump supporter, lifetime democrat. Voting republican in the mid-terms for the first time after the Kavanaugh disgrace.","Hey TD.

Full disclosure, last election I voted for Gary Johnson, and before that I voted 2x for Obama.

I live in the great (swing) state of Michigan and come from a long line of pro-union automotive and construction workers. In my family we voted democrat to protect unions, and that was just the way it was. 

Then the democrats stopped pretending to care about people like us.

When I was a kid, my grandparents had always talked about Trump in a positive way. When I went to the beach and wanted money for ice cream, they would joke, *“Who do you think I am, Donald Trump?”*.

I remember seeing him doing interviews with Larry King and Phil Donahue when I was a little kid, and he was always positive and always talked about a better future for America.

The Kavanaugh hearing and rape accusations finally pushed us all solid right. I called my dad to talk about it and he was already disgusted. He has 3 sons, he knew that could have been *me* up there.

I’ve been a secret Trump supporter over the last year or so, and some of my comments have been linked here for dropping truth bombs on the rest of reddit. That’s over, because I was recently banned from r.news and r.politics for saying some *inconvenient facts*.

Michigan loves Trump, and we are behind him the whole way. I have more hope for this state than I ever have, but only if we get out there and continue to make it happen.

**MAGA**

MEME MAGIC FRIDAY: SLOW AND STEADY EDITION,"#GREETINGS CENTIPEDES!

**Welcome back to another Meme Magic Friday! As usual I am your host, Crusader, and humble meme farmer /u/D4rkd3str0yer.** 


**Our sponsor this week is Bold Text! Bold Text: Same great text, just higher energy. We are also sponsored this week by Beer. Not that feminist Bud Light shit, I'm talking real, American beer, Yuengling. Drank by Chadvanaughs everywhere!**

**It has been quite a few weeks! Old enemies became allies, old allies stepped up to the plate, the GEOTUS cucked Canada, and I realized that no, I am not, in fact, tired of winning (for those of you who are tired of winning, I hear /r/The_Mueller is accepting mod applications).**

**Who could have predicted the turnaround of [LINDSAY FUCKING GRAHAM](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/491453197336969225/497840830229250049/rif-1538764874448.jpg)? His epic [BTFO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKSRUK-l7dM) of the Democratic ""Senators"" was on the level of ""You'd be in jail"". After hearing that smackdown I had an immediate overpowering impulse to go to my fridge and shotgun a beer in honor of Judge Kavanaugh. Truly some powerful stuff folks. Then Kanye, Yeezy himself, BTFO'd Democrats on their home turf on SNL. Keenan Thompson was so butthurt that he bitched about not being able to criticize Trump and disagree...on SNL. I suppose since no one watches SNL anymore (Sad!) he thought it was the equivalent of being deplatformed? Steven Crowder (Who is having an AMA on your favorite domreddit, Tuesday at 6PM EST) [revealed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6dv6G1FWxk) that TCU actually stands for ""Triggered Cuck University"" and actually made them [admit](https://i.redd.it/jgtwpeny26q11.png) that they think *their own campus* has a rape problem. Next up, Boss Turntle (the namesake of this edition of MMF) himself Mitch McConnell. Clearly he's doing something right, since the [Fake](http://archive.is/dips2) [News](http://archive.is/RPI6s) [Media](http://archive.is/AW8bx) has once again started writing hitpieces on our reptilian majority leader. And finally, Senator Orrin Hatch absolutely [ended](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/9lgboz/orrin_hatch_handles_a_protester/) a group of protestors, shooing them off like the gadflies they are and telling them what their parents are thinking: ""Grow up"".**

One of the shitty things about rape accusations is that, without evidence, everyone will now form their own theory for truth. Kav had more than enough evidence to show that it could not have been him, and the accuser couldn’t get her story straight , but unfortunately no amount of evidence on the planet will convince them otherwise.

Daily Bible Scripture: Daniel 6:19-23,"[Daniel 6:19-23 ESV] Then, at break of day, the king arose and went in haste to the den of lions. As he came near to the den where Daniel was, he cried out in a tone of anguish. The king declared to Daniel, “O Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to deliver you from the lions?” 

Then Daniel said to the king, “O king, live forever! My God sent his angel and shut the lions’ mouths, and they have not harmed me, because I was found blameless before him; and also before you, O king, I have done no harm.” Then the king was exceedingly glad, and commanded that Daniel be taken up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no kind of harm was found on him, because he had trusted in his God.

"Secret Trump supporter, lifetime democrat. Voting republican in the mid-terms for the first time after the Kavanaugh disgrace.","Hey TD.

Full disclosure, last election I voted for Gary Johnson, and before that I voted 2x for Obama.

I live in the great (swing) state of Michigan and come from a long line of pro-union automotive and construction workers. In my family we voted democrat to protect unions, and that was just the way it was. 

Then the democrats stopped pretending to care about people like us.

When I was a kid, my grandparents had always talked about Trump in a positive way. When I went to the beach and wanted money for ice cream, they would joke, *“Who do you think I am, Donald Trump?”*.

I remember seeing him doing interviews with Larry King and Phil Donahue when I was a little kid, and he was always positive and always talked about a better future for America.

The Kavanaugh hearing and rape accusations finally pushed us all solid right. I called my dad to talk about it and he was already disgusted. He has 3 sons, he knew that could have been *me* up there.

I’ve been a secret Trump supporter over the last year or so, and some of my comments have been linked here for dropping truth bombs on the rest of reddit. That’s over, because I was recently banned from r.news and r.politics for saying some *inconvenient facts*.

Michigan loves Trump, and we are behind him the whole way. I have more hope for this state than I ever have, but only if we get out there and continue to make it happen.

**MAGA**

MEME MAGIC FRIDAY: SLOW AND STEADY EDITION,"#GREETINGS CENTIPEDES!

**Welcome back to another Meme Magic Friday! As usual I am your host, Crusader, and humble meme farmer /u/D4rkd3str0yer.** 


**Our sponsor this week is Bold Text! Bold Text: Same great text, just higher energy. We are also sponsored this week by Beer. Not that feminist Bud Light shit, I'm talking real, American beer, Yuengling. Drank by Chadvanaughs everywhere!**

**It has been quite a few weeks! Old enemies became allies, old allies stepped up to the plate, the GEOTUS cucked Canada, and I realized that no, I am not, in fact, tired of winning (for those of you who are tired of winning, I hear /r/The_Mueller is accepting mod applications).**

**Who could have predicted the turnaround of [LINDSAY FUCKING GRAHAM](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/491453197336969225/497840830229250049/rif-1538764874448.jpg)? His epic [BTFO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKSRUK-l7dM) of the Democratic ""Senators"" was on the level of ""You'd be in jail"". After hearing that smackdown I had an immediate overpowering impulse to go to my fridge and shotgun a beer in honor of Judge Kavanaugh. Truly some powerful stuff folks. Then Kanye, Yeezy himself, BTFO'd Democrats on their home turf on SNL. Keenan Thompson was so butthurt that he bitched about not being able to criticize Trump and disagree...on SNL. I suppose since no one watches SNL anymore (Sad!) he thought it was the equivalent of being deplatformed? Steven Crowder (Who is having an AMA on your favorite domreddit, Tuesday at 6PM EST) [revealed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6dv6G1FWxk) that TCU actually stands for ""Triggered Cuck University"" and actually made them [admit](https://i.redd.it/jgtwpeny26q11.png) that they think *their own campus* has a rape problem. Next up, Boss Turntle (the namesake of this edition of MMF) himself Mitch McConnell. Clearly he's doing something right, since the [Fake](http://archive.is/dips2) [News](http://archive.is/RPI6s) [Media](http://archive.is/AW8bx) has once again started writing hitpieces on our reptilian majority leader. And finally, Senator Orrin Hatch absolutely [ended](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/9lgboz/orrin_hatch_handles_a_protester/) a group of protestors, shooing them off like the gadflies they are and telling them what their parents are thinking: ""Grow up"".**

MAGAthread Watch Party: The Confirmation Vote of Judge Brett Kavanaugh,"***

##**GOOD AFTERNOON PATRIOTS!** 

[ARE YOU GUYS READY FOR MORE WINNING!?](http://magaimg.net/img/6db7.gif)


***

**The final Senate vote on Judge Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court is expected to take place later on today (between 3-5 PM ET)**. - Could potentially be a lot sooner, around 3:30 PM (see updates below for more details!!)

Yesterday, The Senate voted 51-49 to limit debate on the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court. Senators Flake, Collins, and Manchin voted in favor of the motion. Senator Murkowski voted against it.

We'll have all your updates and livestreams right here on r/The_Donald! There will of course be an overload of salt and **REEEEEEE**ing so don't forget to do a little mining while we wait for our new SCOTUS!

Brian Banks: A man who was falsely accused of rape and almost paid for the lie with a life sentence. Read his story on Wikipedia.

Faced with a possible 41 years to life sentence, he accepted a plea deal that included five years in prison, five years of probation, and registering as a sex offender. Wanetta Gibson and her mother Wanda Rhodes sued the Long Beach Unified School District, claiming the Poly campus was not a safe environment, and won a $1.5 million settlement. Banks says that the lawyer said that by pleading guilty he would receive probation, but no jail time.

>In March 2011, Gibson contacted Banks on Facebook, met with him, and admitted in the presence of an attorney that she had fabricated the story. Banks secretly recorded Gibson's confession, but she later refused to tell prosecutors that she had lied so she wouldn't have to return the money she and her family had won in court.",CA[deleted],3,2018-10-06 14:19:41
