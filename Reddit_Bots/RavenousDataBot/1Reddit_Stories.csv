TIFU by trying to teach my kids bugs are fun.,"So... Most of these start off with ""not today but...."". However, this one is today and ongoing! Four weeks ago (may 15th) I thought it would be hella cool to buy one of those habitats that has multiple praying mantis egg sacks and watch them hatch with my kids. The plan was to release them in the front and back yard. So the package comes and one of my kids (4 year old) is perplexed and the other (11 years) is like F\-you, gross. We check them every day for the first week or two and nothing happened. The excitement died off but we still checked it every 2\-3 days. My 11 year old has a Girl Scout trip to Hershey, PA this last weekend so we spent Friday and Sat night and drove home Sunday, getting home late afternoon. I cannot find this habitat anywhere.. I was like WTF. We do have a cleaning lady that is known to put stuff away and we have to look for it so it was nothing out of the ordinary, it will turn up.  

Some come today I am sitting in a meeting and my wife texts me at noon and says ""OMG praying mantis are all over the couch.""... I drove home (only 10 mins away) and sure as shit I see 10 or so baby mantis crawling all over my couch. I start to take apart my sectional so I can find where they are coming from. Finally I find one egg stack, pick it up and take it outside. As I am walking outside with it mantis are crawling out of it and jumping. I then find out my dog chewed the habitat, the dog watcher cleaned up the mess and did not tell us. Problem is.... that habitat had 3 egg sacks, I found one. So ether the dog watcher cleaned up and threw away some or I potentially have 1\-2 more egg sacks in my living room. Each egg sack has 50\-200 praying mantis. Damn it.   

TLDR \- Purchased \~500\+ praying mantis. Dog thought it would be funny to release them all over my living room.

TIFU by entering in a war with my dad’s neighbor and getting the cops called on me!,"Mandatory, this didn’t happen today, but it happened last weekend, Saturday morning! I also apologize for possible fuck ups with my writing, I am not a native and I can have some problems explain very detailed situations in English.

So Saturday morning, I was helping my dad chopping some wood, something he regularly does and when I don’t have nothing planned for the weekends, I drop by and give him an hand. He has some land close to his house, where we were chopping the wood…between that land and my parents house, happens to be their neighbor residence that also has quite a bit of land around it, more like a farm, where he has a lot of fruit trees, horses, etc…he is a wealthy very old guy!

After we are done with the wood, I was contemplating a huge Cherry tree, full of red and likely delicious cherries, that while inside the neighbors property were accessible from the road. My dad noticed and said: “Completely full of cherries huh? Don’t even think about it, that old guy complains about everything…don’t give him an excuse to be himself!”

My dad was still gathering some stuff, so I told him I would meet him at his place and I would go in front to chat a bit with my mom before we have launch…using that road, I spot the old guy at his land between his horses while I am passing by the cherry tree! Wel,l since he is seeing me, there is no harm in just pick one cherry, it will be pretty much in front of the guy, I am just having one out of curiosity, I am not hiding and stealing…should be harmless, despite how allegedly annoying this guy is. So I picked one, ate it and was in fact delicious!

Yeah, no…it wasn’t harmless.

I got a call and I stop in the middle of road to answer it, so I took some time from reaching my parents house, despite being something like a 2 minute walk! I ended the conversation and procced my journey, when I was walking by the entrance of the old man’s farm he was there, looking angry at me and signals me with his hand for me to approach! “You got be kidding me I thought!”

I am not going to write the dialogue back and forth, because this post will already be very long, but he very loudly accuse me of stealing…the people living close by could clearly hearing this idiot shouting…that I wasn’t respectful towards other people propriety…at first, I really tried to defuse the situation, since despite how ludicrous the situation might be, I was the one who took something that wasn’t mine, so I apologized a couple of times! But he went on and on, and when he started to get verbally aggressive, asking me if I was mentally retarded or just a thief, I kinda lost my composure a little bit and asked him how sad and little he had to be for doing this scene over a fucking cherry! “It’s the principle of it, I had enough of you when you and your friends stole fruit from me as kids”…This was false, I assume that to him, kids are all “the same” and probably a lot of kids stole his cherries, apples, oranges, etc…but despite me being a brat as a kid and I have indeed done my share of bad stuff in my days, I never messed with this guy or his stuff before, mainly because it was my neighbor at the time, so it would immediately lead to me being grounded by proxy! In fact, I think I have spoke with this idiot like twice before this encounter, many years ago when I still lived there…

I told him he was senile, that I never took something from him before and sarcastically asked if he could ever forgive me for the valuable cherry I took from him! As I was moving away from him, I kept hearing him barking some stuff, which I assumed it were insults!

I spoke a bit with my mom, while we waited from my dad, which was taking longer than we expected…when he finally arrived, his 1st words were: “You just had to do it…I fucking told you to not mess with that crazy old man, but you just couldn’t resist…”

Basically, my dad took the same road as me and the old man was also waiting for him, complaining about the situation and also getting verbally abusive towards my dad, concerning the way I was raised! So my dad, while also considering the situation the most ridiculous thing ever, still gives me an hard time for “being an idiot”!

This upsets me for the rest of the day…how can someone be so, well so “like this”! When I arrived home, my fiancé was leaving for the rest of the afternoon, so it didn’t help I was going to spend the afternoon alone, having time keep focusing on the situation… I turned on the pc to play a game, but I couldn’t just shake the situation out of my head…

And this is where the things start  going downhill…

I grab my keys, get into my car and drive to the closest super market…I then buy  a bag with 1kg of cherries and one of those gift ribbons (not sure if this is the word)! Taped to the bag is a postal card, saying something that can roughly be translated to English “Hope this gift can help you recover from your illness, sincerely…your favorite “thief”! ” YES I KNOW THIS WAS CHILDISH! But what do you want from me?!

I then drive to my dad’s village, go to the cherry tree with the bag, figuring my way of planting the bag, without being spotted…but I couldn’t just threw the bag over, because he might miss it! The wall limiting his land, was very short on one of the sides close to the tree and I saw no one, so I just easily jumped over... I was about to hang the bag in one of the branches, when he appears out of nowhere, asking me what the fuck I was doing there!

I smiled and said: “I come offering reparations for my errors” – he looks at the bag and probably saw immediately that I was doing some kind of joke and also replies with a smile: “Do you understand that you are trespassing into my property don’t you?!” – he then does a very loud whistle and shouts for Pongo and a other name I couldn’t figure it out…

I immediately knew what was going to happen and I was right…dogs…now I am not going to lie to you and try to make this story more scary than it was…It weren’t Rottweilers or German Sheppards or anything like that. It were two black Labradors, very fat and actually cute…they took a while to show up which made the whole situation a little awkward, since none of us spoke a word till they arrived, we just stood there looking at each other! But when they arrived, despite if they had or hadn’t intention to bite me, when they saw me they immediately started to bark towards me, they didn’t run but they were coming close…taking no chances, I started to run towards the short wall I came in to and jumped over, not even realizing if I was being chased or not, but I could hearing the old man laughing behind me!

I procced to my car and realize, I never planted the bag and I was still holding it…another major fail…

I go home and stay there for the rest of the afternoon, grumpy in my couch, feeling stupid…close to dinner time, my gf calls me saying there were cops at the door, asking if I lived there and if they could speak with me!

IS THIS REALLY HAPPENING?! (I tought)

I then go out to meet two agents, who told me Mr. Neighbor had called the cops, because someone trespassed and damaged his wall…they went to his house listen to the story but saw no damage what so ever on the wall, the old man explained them who I was but didn’t knew my current address, but pointed that my parents lived next door and they would know! My parents weren’t at home but another neighbor who is friends with my folks, happens to know where I live and “kindly” told the officers…

One of them was actually quite friendly and listened to my whole story, since me picking the cherry until my escape from the dogs…I could tell one of them was clearly making an effort for not to laugh. 

They then point out, it was actually lucky that the other neighbor could tell them where I lived, so they could talk with me right way personally and desmiss it as ""actuall occurrence"", instead of me getting a formal notification to present my self to the police station.

They tell me that this situation with most likely end there, there was no damage on the wall and this guy is known for calling the police over everything and they try to ignore it as much as they legally can…they will contact my dad’s neighbor, telling him I was reprehended and warned to respect other people’s property and it will hopefully suffice! But still warn me, that if the next days I get a notification on the mail, to present myself on the station, it means that he decided to follow trough with the charges…when they are about to leave, and this is the most humiliating part, one of officers say: “Man how old are you?”…which I replied 29…and while shaking his head, he leaves, not controlling his laugh this time…

TL;DR: I started a stupid argument over a cherry with my dad's old neighbor, which escalated in a “soap opera way” and ended up me trespassing, being chased by dogs and getting the cops called on me!

TIFU by smashing my brother's phone,"I feel so sorry to my little brother (12) for what i've(21) done. The phone was a gift given by our dad and it was his third android phone because he always has the tendecy to break it by being so careless, but this time it was my fault. He has an issue of playing too much mobile games that he can even eat for a whole day so that he can just play. Since last week, my parents are controllig his gaming addiction by giving him a few hours each day to play but he won't comply with them. He still play for extended hours late night until 3am. Today i saw the frustration on our mother wherein she cant control the problem anymore and that's when i decided to step in. I scolded him telling him that he should fix his act and look at the stress he's giving to our mom but he kept talking back saying he doesnt care about us and he doesnt want to talk to us. That's when i snapped, i just  cant take it anymore seeing our mom so tired from work being too stresses out on my brother,so i took his phone and told him ""check this out"" and then smashed the phone on the floor. He got mad and started crying saying ""i'd smash your phone next"". Our mom was shocked on what ive done, she asked why did i do that, why didnt i think about what our dad had to go through to buy this gift for my brother. That's when i realized that i shouldve not done that. i hugged my brother and told him to fix his self up and help with the household so i can give my own phone as a reward.

TIFU by passing out in a Panera Bread,"So this happened a few hours ago. 

I'm currently studying my ass off for a test I have to take. I'm talking making  100+ flashcards a day multiple practice tests, and but loads of reading from the text book. (I'm not comfortable saying WHY I have to study this hard just know I am.)

Anyway my truck I normally use to go to the library (because I can't study at home) had a leak in one of the break lines so is in the shop. That means it's walk or bike everywhere. The library is ten plus miles away and I live in Florida so that's too far in the summer heat. However I have a gift card for a Panera Bread only three miles away. 

So get up and bike to Panera first thing. Now I hadn't had any food or water in over twelve hours at that point and had just biked mostly uphill in Florida heat. So I lock my bike up and go inside and wait in line. The AC feels hella nice and the rapid temperature shift may have been the final nail in the coffin. My head starts felling a little fuzzy and my vision starts to 'white out' next thing I know I'm on the floor to people asking me if they need to call 911 and a very nice employee offering me a glass of water. 

I get up drink the water (slowly) and take a seat for a few minutes till my hearing, and vision goes back to normal.  I get my food and start my day of study. 

I'm actually still in the Panera at this point, and the staff is still keeping an eye on me. 

TLDR I pushed myself too hard and passed out in a Panera and almost went to the hospital.

Tifu by eating a brownie and ended up missing a huge job oppertunity.,"So, unlike alot of the ones I see on r/tifu, this one did actually happen today( 6/13/18 as of the time written). Also typing on mobile so rip. Anyway, some background info, im an 18m highschool graduate without the funds (or desire really) to go to college. On top of that my sleeping problem has gotten worse as days went on (due to another thing that one day ill write a tifu, you know for that sweet karma /s) so yesterday I woke up late at around 10:30 or so and am late for at least helping my dad at the shop (currently live with him) i get up and tell his gf how im haveing a really hard time sleeping and went to bed at 5:00 in the morning. She gives me an indica pot brownie for my sleep and tells me not to tell my dad (side business shit). I take the brownie and wait till i need it that night. Now since its a small town, it doesnt get hard to meet important people; one is Capt. Phil. Capt. Phil owns like two different, popular tourist boats and a seafood restraunt or two, basically a pretty prominent dude in this town. He also is a good friend of my pops (grandpa) and my dad, which means I have a really good chance at a good job (we are  talking a potential 8.25 minimum plus tips for a starting position, and free, fresh red snapper to bring home for dinner) Im thrilled and hopeful... not for long. Anyway, Capt. Phil gives me an appointment at around 11:00 tomorrow (today) to meet with me and see where I would best fit in (from what Ive heard, he is really good at that). That night around 1:00 (First mistake) or so I took entire brownie. That is what basically killed me. Took an hour to kick in, and an extra half hour to take effect, finally went to bed around 3:00 (bad but i could manage, besides I had till 11:00; so I'll be fine... right?) Today I woke up at 2:00 in the afternoon. It only got worse in a span of literally 10 min. I called my dad, he's angry because of the fact that I missed it and now Capt. Phil thinks im unreliable with no work ethic (not completely true but actions speak louder than words), the fact that my dads gf wont go to work so he blames it on my generation (his gf is like 26 so closer to my age than his), and he was extremely busy and had alot to do; wasnt even able to tell him that the brownie was the cause of it. Luckily I have one other good opportunity as I know this person... but it is nowhere near as good as what I missed. In the end I just wanted sleep, guess i got it lol.

Tl;dr: took a pot brownie to help me sleep so I could be well rested for an important job opportunity. Woke up at 2:00 in the afternoon, got yelled at by my dad for being seen as unreliable to an important person in my small town (my possible employer) missed out on a job that gave 8:25 plus tips for the starting position (plus free red snapper to bring home), and had my generation (sorry guys) blamed for lack of work ethic and wanting handouts.

TIFU by killing myself on a mower,"Happened 2 Fridays ago. I,own and operate a lawn company and was on our daily routine of mowing. The last several days had been really rainy and we were busy trying to play catch-up. I was at a property that I had mowed a thousand times before but was near this Pond that we have had some trouble with before. I thought that it was dry enough that I could mow or get close to it and even decided to turn around and not mow some of the trickier spots.

My fuck up begins when I tried to turn around and couldn't find traction on the hill. I cut the blades off and tried to back up a little bit more but knew that I couldn't get up so I started heading towards the pond at a 45 degree angle. I thought to myself that I was going to get a little wet and probably have to get the truck and pull the mower out.
However there would be a lot more complication than I realized.

I hit the water and quickly found myself under the water and I thought this is a lot wetter than I really wanted to be. And I try to stand up I realize the mower was on my legs and I couldn't get out from under the mower. This is when it really hit me that I was in a bad situation. I was under enough water that I couldn't get to the surface to breathe. I tried to get my legs out several times but there was no avail. I could get my hand above water and that's all I can do. I sat there for what seemed like days holding my breath and somehow trying to get out but knew I couldn't. I remember saying my final goodbyes and just thinking to myself how all I wanted to do was see my fiance one last time.

Everything got white and I don't really remember what happened next until I was on the shore with people around me. I guess I had the out-of-body experience and could kind of feel myself yelling at people trying to tell them that I was under the mower and they needed to get me out. There just happened to be a worker at the property that happened to see me then pulled me out from underneath the water. He said that once I got out I was blacked out and he set me on the ground and once I came through I started to breathe and water just started pouring out of my nose ears and now. I had the worst feeling in my chest and knew something was wrong and could hardly breathe.

The ambulance came and put me on a stretcher and took me to the ER. I stayed overnight in the hospital and ended up having two broken ribs a bruised lung and the blood vessels in my eyes popped and left me looking like something from The Walking Dead. The mower ended up having to be towed out with a truck and caused over $7,000 worth of damage to the mower and ended up totaling it.

TIFU by unknowingly causing civilians to be assaulted and targeted by an extreme armed group in Syria,"It didn't happen today, but many years ago, and surely it was a fuck up. I'm from Aleppo/Syria. In late 2012, Aleppo the largest city in the country abruptly became a war scene. The islamic oppostion called their operation ""the battle of Furqan"" -Furqan means in Arabic that what separates between justice and injustice, the regime called it ""operation northern storm"", and both called it unofficially the mother of all battles.

Before the battle in 2011 I was 19, I had been arrested in that year 3 times by the regime for protesting, and actively working with small groups to organise protests. We were a large network of groups of friends, most of us were students. In mid 2011 the small groups of students became more organized, and had names. We called ours ""beautiful tomorrow"", a close group we knew its members ""freedom flowers"", one called ""freedom torches"" and so on.

We didn't have a political agenda other than toppling the regime, because simply no one of us had an experience in politics. We had one party, one presidential candidate, one ideology, and we were young and naive, and all of us raised one ambiguous slogan which is Freedom. Slowly as things were unraveling, and new players on the political field started emerging, we more and more became politicized, the word freedom had different interpretations among us. Eventually in 2014 some of us were fighting with salafists, some had died fighting with isis, some died in jail, couple died in protests, and I was working with a political coalition which condemned violence from all sides, and is mostly comprised out kurdish and leftist parties.

Aleppo in 2011 was very passive and didn't witness a real particibation in the protests. We, the small groups of students in some point were almost the only ones protesting, our numbers were in tens, sometimes over a hundred in a protest. We would agree on a time and place, spread the news secretly, and then go out shout in the street for 5 or 10 minutes till we start hearing the sirens afar. we were heavily oppressed.

Our numbers were small and no violence occurred from our side so no lethal force were used by the regime, but everyday friends were getting arrested. Inside you would be humiliated, broken, tortured, put with 40 people in small cell that is suitable only for 4 or 5, noplace to sit, to sleep, or to move, hardly to stand, we had shifts for sleeping. Depending on your background, social class, place of origin in Syria, along with what they believe you did, they determine how long would a person stay in prison. For students in Aleppo the rich, and mostly passive city, it was the shortest with an average around 2 weeks, if poor from a village you could stay for 6 months without trail.

All of us were fighters, knowing the risks and taking it. It was almost like a full time job, calling people, choosing locations to protest, having meetings, sharing information, destroying and erasing evidence if someone got arrested (usually they search social media accounts and sometimes search homes after catching somebody), Some would take videos of protests and upload them to youtube and send them to the media, which was the most dangerous.

Beside the regime, loyalist groups were also working against us, most of them were ex-convicts, and members of loyalist clans in that point. They were brutal and terrorizing, they used swords, and clubs to oppress us. Many times I saw people getting beaten with chains and clubs by 10 men in the street till they are full of their own blood. Loyalist groups were working with the regime directly, and later they were armed by it and became warriors. They were not secretive at all. With our growing numbers, we had a small network of intelligence, we had names, and information about them, the groups of loyalists that were torturing us in the streets.

Another threat was informers in Universities most of them were members of the governmental students' union. No matter how much we tried to be secretive, news would spread to reach them about our activity. I personally got arrested 2 times in the street protesting, one time from home after I was informed on.

we have the names, the information about the loyalists and informers to the regime, and we wanted to publish them on the internet, with pictures, along with the deeds to scandalize them and scare them.
I had a connection with a group of activists and programmers outside of Syria, they had a website and a facebook page called ""thugs of Aleppo""

Friends and people that I know, and some that I don't know well were contacting me to give information about alleged loyalists oppressing protesters, and alleged informers. All of that was before the militaristic violence, and open terrorism. I only took what I was certain of, and people's names and faces started to appear online as informers, and assailants on protests.

Before mid 2012 things started to escalate. More and more people were protesting, and as the lower struggling classes joined in, the protests became violent, men with AK-47s in protests shooting the regime security, the regime deploying units from its most notorious security branches, and the result was blood and total choas in the streets. Couple of small armed groups started operating within the city, and they targeted and killed civilians who allegedly worked with the regime. The media went insane. Lies and only lies were being told. I opposed violence, argued for hours with activists, then I quit. almost everyone I worked with called me a traitor, and months later many of them became warriors with different factions, or activists working with armed groups.

In july 2012 after hearing a lot of rumors, I remember the day was Friday, and it was 12 o'clock in the noon. Armed opposition groups from the countryside of Aleppo entered the city. There was no military presence from the regime at all. The opposition quitely spreaded in eastern Aleppo, which is the poor half of the city. The security forces made barricades to deter them, and the city was torn along class lines. A week later the Syrian army reinforcement arrived, opposition as well, and the city became a blood bath.

In that time the activists that managed the website and page of ""thugs of Aleppo"" were working with televised media, particularly a TV channel called Orient news, and they were on TV showing pictures of alleged informers and violent loyalists. All the names, and photos and information that I sent the activists was on TV, a scale that I didn't want. Some of the people were college students, and classmates who were members or working with the students union, and all were in western Aleppo the regime side of the city.

I started getting the news. A grocery shop owner who one day shot couple of bullets in the air to scare us while we were protesting was assaulted by an armed group, and was shot and severely injured. A classmate from the student union was abducted, and tortured, then released after his family paid a very huge ransom for his life. All the rest received death threats and were asked to leave the country, and I think all did. Noone was killed fortunately from the people that I sent their infos to the activists outside of Syria, but others from the same website were.

In the same day when the opposition stormed the city I  left home and became displaced as my neighborhood was overrun by the them. From july 2012 till late 2014, I lived in Aleppo during the war. In October 2014, I became a refugee.

TL;DR : after becoming a protester and an activist against the regime (liberal, pacifist) through other activists who owned a website and with information that my group gathered, I started uploading photos and information of regime informers and loyalists who attacks protesters to the internet, and eventually the photos and info ended up on TV. Months later one of the people that I helped scandalizing was shot in the leg in his shop, other was abducted, and the rest were threatened to be killed if they didn't leave the country.",44,6/13/2018 5:53,tifu,Qdr-91,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8qpqtr/tifu_by_unknowingly_causing_civilians_to_be/,/r/tifu/comments/8qpqtr/tifu_by_unknowingly_causing_civilians_to_be/,8qpqtr,"well...

TIFU by infecting my girlfriend with the EBV-virus,"It was today's morning, I woke up in full peace and expected nothing bad, until I looked at my phone and saw the message my girlfriend of two months sent me. She's sick for around 6 days now, we thought she's got the flu or something. Apparently her doctor called her back today with the results. She has got mononucleosis, which is caused by the Epstein\-Barr virus. Only to tell you what this is very short: It's a virus which 90&#37; of all people have, it causes the same symptoms like a flu and occurs by the oral transfer of salvia \- which means kissing. [Here's the wikipedia link if you're interested](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epstein%E2%80%93Barr_virus). It's nothing serious, it's just that a couple weeks after incubation it's like a really heavy version of the flu and once it's gone, it's gone and you're totally immune against that.

So as you can imagine \- my girlfriend is very stressed with her exams lately, we still have a little fight which is not really argued out yet and now she has a virus and thinks she's got it from me! The funny thing is: She may be right!

When I was a kid, I remember clearly having this virus in my blood, but never had any of these heavy symptoms my girlfriend has. When I googled what exactly her illness is, I instantly knew that this is the exact same virus I had / still have. Now I think she will be even more mad at me...

Advice: What do I do now? Do I tell her? Or not? I mean she could easily have caught this from anywhere else? Help me, reddit people! :D

TLDR: infected my gf with a virus, she can't be sure if she's got it from me or from somewhere else, now she's mad at me",2,6/13/2018 19:22,tifu,Zwerghuhn,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8quq6o/tifu_by_infecting_my_girlfriend_with_the_ebvvirus/,/r/tifu/comments/8quq6o/tifu_by_infecting_my_girlfriend_with_the_ebvvirus/,8quq6o,"She could have gotten Mono from anywhere.

TIFU by falling for a modern day Nigerian Prince scam.,"So this actually happened today.

I was selling a laptop on Facebook to try and get some quick cash and this guy (I think he was Indian) messaged me with an over full price offer. The catch was that he was “not local,” but he’d pay the shipping. It totaled about $380. I’d later learn he wanted me to send it to Nigeria.

So he gets pushy about me shipping it out next day, says that once I ship PayPal deposits the money. I’m not 100% comfortable, but whatever I’m about to get way more than it is worth. There were 1000 red flags at this point, buuuuuuut me. Lmao.

Forward to today, I take it to the post office and he’s still very pushy. I sent the tracking number to “PayPal” and then they asked for a scanned copy of the receipt. Luckily I was at school and couldn’t do it right away.

I texted my boyfriend about it, he logged into my PayPal, and next thing you know, I’m crying in my OChem lab and rushing out to the post office to try and get the package I dropped off an hour ago. They hadn’t shipped it out and I got a refund on the shipping costs.

My boyfriend thinks this is the funniest thing in the world that he now knows a person who fell for a fucking Nigerian scam.

tldr; Guy in Nigeria wanted to buy my laptop on Facebook. Turned out to be the modern day Nigerian Prince scam and I saved my laptop from being shipped out by about 1 hour.",1,6/13/2018 22:46,tifu,samsonwentbacktobed,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8qwd9b/tifu_by_falling_for_a_modern_day_nigerian_prince/,/r/tifu/comments/8qwd9b/tifu_by_falling_for_a_modern_day_nigerian_prince/,8qwd9b,"If They’re rushing you, back away",CA[deleted],1,55:19.6
TIFU by following my urge to save bugs.,"So this TIFU happened about two hours ago. I decided to go out to the back yard with my dad and he starts to clean the pool. I see near the edge that there is a bee struggling in the water. I think 'no big deal, I've saved plenty of bees from the pool.'
This was obviously the wrong choice. 
I try to cup my hand to splash it out, it doesn't work, I feel bad and try again, failed again. I go for third times the charm, success, sort of...
I now have a very agitated bee in my hand, and of course she stings me right between my ring finger and pinkie. I go into emergency mode because I know I need to get the stinger out fast and get baking soda on it. I rush into the house, but it takes me longer than I want to get it out. I call my mother to make the paste. 
I sat down and it all hit me. I got a wave of heat, heavy sweat, my vision goes black. I'm about to faint. I have a history of fainting, but the last one was over 3 years ago, and I have never fainted from a bee!
I end up being picked up by my mom and brother and being laid on the floor so that I don't fall. I am nauseous, light headed, covered in ice packs, and my hand is packed with soda paste. 
After about 15 minutes I was fine, just a little swollen and really had to pee. It bummed me out that all I wanted to do was save a bee, and I end up nearly fainting, and now the bee is dead. 

I am no longer allowed to save bees. RIP little lady. 

TL;DR
Tried to save bee, got stung by said bee, result: I almost fainted and bee is now dead.

Tifu by texting someone that he was a c**k block,"So, this didn't happen today but this past weekend... 

Weddings, they are fun for so many reasons the dancing, the good food, the drinking and the celebrating. Also the potential to meet new people. And meet new people I did. But more on that later…

My best friend from since I was three, aka forever, got married this past weekend. It was a beautiful beach wedding and it was a boatload of work and all in all a wonderful time. It was one of the best times I’ve had at a wedding in a long time, hands down.

Now this story might be a long one but it’s hilariously embarrassing for me so I just felt the need to share it with the world. Because I swear sometimes my life is a cheesy sit-com and you just have to laugh and enjoy the ride.

So here is the back story. A few months ago while working on stuff for her wedding Hannah told me that she had someone she wanted me to meet at the wedding. The best man, Quincy. She goes on and on about him and how we would be perfect for each other and blah blah blah. True to me I disregard everything she says and say, that I don’t believe her and basically just write the whole thing off and forget about it. After all, I’m stupidly picky when it comes to men and I don’t fall easily, never had a good experience being set up with someone “perfect for me” and tend to be the heartbreaking sort. Yay me, lol.

Anyway, fast forward to this weekend and I’m setting up chairs for the ceremony look up and wham, it hits me like a ton of bricks, that freaking smile, out of no where, didn’t even know it was him until later. Bitch (in the most loving way) was right. lol. To be honest, I’m not the type who likes anyone when I first meet them but I hadn’t even met him and was already crushing. That instant crushing has only happened to me one other time in my whole life. I actually can’t believe I’m even admitting this but that’s ok. So we make introductions and it’s mutual, he starts flirting with me right away! So here I am now very intrigued and excited to get to know this guy.

So the rehearsal goes by without any issue and we have all finished working for the night and so I head out to the bonfire to enjoy the night and Quincy follows me out. We start chatting and a few minutes later his friend Larry shows up “hey guys what’s going on?” Innocent enough, but no longer alone. No big deal. So we all start chatting and other people come over and we all just have a nice evening by the fire chatting.

Side note: Larry is my counterpart in the wedding and a bit awkward, he doesn’t know anyone other than the groom and the grooms men so he was kinda a lost puppy following me around most of the time. Sweet guy but definitely not my type.

Saturday rolls around and it’s the big day! We are all busy working to get ready and Quincy asks me if I can come to breakfast with the guys. I tell them “no can do Hannah has too much for me to do today so I’m going to have to pass”. He looks a little bummed but I’m there to help get things done not flirt with him. So we chat occasionally throughout the day but not a lot because of all the chaos going on.

Finally it’s time for the wedding and I can take my bossy pants off and have some fun!! So the ceremony goes by without issue and I get all the chairs moved and at the right tables and get through the receiving line and finally can relax and I start drinking. Yay party time. So dinner comes and goes and beers come and go and the party is in full swing. I finally get a chance to talk with Quincy one on one, we start up a conversation and we are flirting, laughing and touching arms and the out of no where Larry shows up “hey guys what’s going on”. Sigh.

So we chat and I leave for another beverage and chat with some more people and hang with Hannah and Quincy do some dancing and chat some more with Quincy and through all of this we are getting flirtier and flirtier and touchier. It’s to the point where I fall over at one point because he’s leaning on me while he is trying to tickle me and he chases me under a table because I’m trying to “escape”. Did I mention that massive amounts of alcohol may have been involved? Lol

So party ends and the rain starts and we all head inside. I go up to the kitchen to get some water and Quincy follows me up. We start talking and he is playing with my new tattoo on my wrist and it’s a very sweet moment. Then out of no where Larry shows up “hey guys what’s going on?” Ugggh.

So we chat for a bit get more drinks, help get the bride and groom out the door and plan the rest of the evening. Eventually Quincy and I make it out to the porch and start talking again, 30 seconds later Larry shows up, “hey guys what’s going on?” So we talk and get more drinks and get the group together to head to the guest house that the party will continue at.

So a group of us heads over and three of us go out to the garage to smoke cigarettes (don’t judge, I’m drunk, lol). So the third person that went out gets the hint and leaves Quincy and I alone. FINALLY! We are legitimately alone and can maybe see if this is more than just playful flirting. So we are taking and getting closer and he is about to kiss me and f’ing Larry shows up again “hey guys what’s going on?”. F you Larry, F you! So, we say oh we’re just having a cigarette and we are heading in, everyone else is inside. Doesn’t get the clue and continues to hang out with us for another 30 minutes. So eventually we give up and go inside and continue the flirting and eventually it’s time to leave. So we say goodbye and part ways.

So back at the house I’m getting teased for my flirting all night and leaving the guy with nothing, which is fine, I was expecting it. So getting ready for bed I decided to text Hannah about my frustrations with Larry and send her “Ugh, c**k block Larry, lol.” Now normally there is no service at the house so I’m thinking this isn’t going to be sent till I leave in the morning if at all and I’ll have a nice laugh about it in the morning. Nope sends right away. Ok, odd but whatever, I’m drunk and don’t really know what I’m doing anyway.

So morning rolls around and I look at my phone and my stomach drops. Oh holy F, I sent it to Hanah and f’ing Larry and it was delivered!! F F F F. So I know that Hannah got it but I don’t think Larry has because he was in a bad service area. So he comes over in the morning with Quincy because we all planned to go to breakfast so I had to do damage control. So I pulled him aside and apologized for my drunken text from last night and he didn’t know what I was talking about because he hadn’t gotten it yet, but I told him he would know when he got it. Uggh, embarrassment #1.

So I didn’t know at the time but Quincy had lost his phone and as we left he was using Larry’s phone to try to find his phone. So not only did I send that message to Larry, Quincy was the one who got it!!! 😱 embarrassment #2.

So there it is, my hilariously embarrassing story from my best friends wedding. Thanks for reading, hope you find it as funny as I do now. Who knows maybe one day Quincy and I will laugh about it together, but as of now, it’s just a funny story from a wedding. Either way it's a bad idea to text your friend when drunk at 3am.

Tifu by leaving my safe unlocked and My ex robbed me Saturday,"So this happened a couple days ago. About a year and a half ago I broke up with my ex. She decided to start stalking me aggressively. I had to get a restraining order and move to a different side of town. She found out where I lived and started harassing me online, phone and in person. It took 3 attempts to get the Jacksonville police to arrest her. Well the restraining order was up in April. So to now. On Saturday I got drunk and called a fuck buddy over to have some freaky sex. All good. All fun. Well, I passed out naked on the couch. She was watching tv hanging out. My ex shows up and starts arguing with her and demands she leave. She said no and my ex proceeded to tell her we were getting back together and it was her house. So the fuck buddy got mad and left. So my ex was left inside my house. Apparently I left my safe unlocked and she was able to steal 4,000.00 in cash and some small personal items. So I can’t file it on insurance since they will only cover up to 200.00. I can’t prove she stole anything or was there. So I’m out 4,000.00 and my fuck buddy is mad at me because I thought she took it. I sincerely hate that bitch.

ALL LINKS ARE NSFW. Many link to their patreons. consider supporting them for more games.  Do some searching and you probably can find downloads for most of these games (other than Pandorium as it has always on drm.)

[Trials in a Tainted Space](https://www.fenoxo.com/category/trials-in-tainted-space/) - Text based world exploration with aspects of transformation. 

[Corruption of Champions](https://www.fenoxo.com/play/playcoc.html) - same creator. Text based, you go to another world / dimension and explore.

[Princess Trainer Gold](https://www.lewdgamer.com/tag/princess-trainer-gold-edition) - Animated, Jasmine from aladdin is ""given"" to you and you train her to become sexually insatiable. 

[Witch Trainer with Sad Crab Mod](http://incestgames.net/witch-trainer-version-1-6f-mod-by-sad-crab/) - you play as dumbledore and corrupt hermoine. created by same person as Princess trainer.

[Four Elements trainer](https://www.patreon.com/mity) - you play as the avatar and try to corrupt characters from the show. As it suggests there are 4 chapters/characters.

[Pandorium](https://www.patreon.com/costello/posts) - you are starting a colony on a new planet, breed and train colonists. Recently have added aliens/other species to crossbreed with. In development and not a whole lot to do. more like a mobile game.

[Liliths Throne](https://www.patreon.com/innoxia) Another Text based game but this one has a great UI. In development and the developer puts out weekly updates. I really like this game and prefer it over TiTS and CoC. you are transported to a demon dimension based around sex.

[Kamidori Alchemy Meister](https://vndb.org/v5652) - A Japanese turn based tactics strategy game. It has great gameplay and is less lewd than the others and but is definitely there. good game even without the sex. 

[Cloud Meadow](https://www.patreon.com/CloudMeadow) - a breeding / farming game with dungeon crawling.  This seems to be from the majority of the team of breeding season. This is one that i have not actually played myself but have been following development for quite some time. I am waiting for a full game on this one. however from what ive read it looks really good even in its current state.

[Malise and the Machine](https://www.patreon.com/eromancer) - This looks to be a game with an insane level of polish. But because of this its development is extrmely slow. It hasnt had an update for a long time as they are building a new engine from scratch but they are fully in active development. The screenshots and videos theyve put out about it look incredible. This one is one to follow purely from the potential. It looks on par with AAA games.

[Glamour](https://www.patreon.com/sandlustgames) - Created by Dark Silver who created Big Brother (a game where you are trying to sleep with your mom, sisters, aunt, and another character, has great graphics. got removed off of patreon for the incest stuff if your into it. not usually my cup of tea). they are known for having great visuals and its relatively early in but looks pretty damn good and there is no incest.

[Katawa Shoujo](https://www.katawa-shoujo.com/) - Visual Novel. you play a guy who goes to a school for people with physical disabilities.  This is a very surprisingly compelling game which started on 4Chan of all places and has a loyal fanbase.

[Free Cities](https://www.reddit.com/r/freecitiesgame/) - a Text based game, you create a future city where prostitution is everywhere. its a pretty complex game and theres quite a bit to it. The development has appeared to have stopped but its worth a check out. there is rape and has some pretty extreme content, some of which can be removed. It has its own subreddit as well.

[Strip Poker Night at the Inventory](https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/) - Strip poker but with many characters from games, anime, and cartoons. Has its own subreddit and characters get added all the time. 

[Roundscape Adorevia](https://www.patreon.com/Roundscape) - a RPG creator game that is pretty well developed and has a pretty loyal following. I suggest them because im really interested in the next game they are going to release.

[Night Games](https://www.patreon.com/silverbardgames/overview) - another text based game, you are the only male in a sexfighting game that occurs nightly on a college campus. you can develop relationships with the other contestents as well. a unique and fun concept.  Their other game Seven Minutes in Heaven is also a cool little game, simulating a spin the bottle scenario.

There are several more and patreon is a great place to find new games.",CA[deleted],32,26:04.0

- Cleaning that little spot behind the toilet. Yes, that place that nobody looks and nobody can reach comfortably.

- Cleaning places that your hands touch frequently; for example: light switches, door handles, door-sides. You'll be surpised by how gray/black those places can get. Tylex works wonders on it.

- Cleaning dish-drying pans especially if they're light-colored. It gets the same pinkish-brownish slime that shower liners get if you don't change them frequently. Disgusting and more difficult to get rid of than most people think.

"Dear nurses and doctors of reddit, what injuries have you seen with the oddest or funniest backstory?",,14,6/14/2018 2:21,AskReddit,spuped_n_duped,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/8qxukr/dear_nurses_and_doctors_of_reddit_what_injuries/,/r/AskReddit/comments/8qxukr/dear_nurses_and_doctors_of_reddit_what_injuries/,8qxukr,"A friend doing her Emergency Department rotation as part of her medical training had someone come in.  Apparently, his butt hurt.  Now, butt stuff is exceedingly common.  For some reason, people like to shove the old style lightbulbs up, then realize that shattered glass in an anus is not a great idea.  However, this guy was special.

My friend has him drop is pants, and staring at her is the worst, most disgusting case of anal warts she has ever seen.  She's a physician and has seen some stuff, but she excused herself quickly to avoid vomiting.  Apparently, he had been trying to ""self-treat"" and this involved some sort of mutilation leading to infection.

Now, this genius not only was trying to cut out his own anus with a dirty pocket knife, he had a good backstory.  You see, there's pretty much only one way men get anal warts: unprotected gay sex.  But this guy needed my friend to know he wasn't like that.  No.

As he explained it, he had been drinking at home alone (definitely no men there), and decided it would be a good idea to climb into bed naked without and sheets.  He was passing out, and could barely move when his dog climbed on him and started having sex with him so violently, it ripped out part of his butt.  He said this to a medical professional who knew the ""H"" in HPV that causes genital warts is for ""Human.""

Moral of the story: if there's something wrong, go see a doctor.  You don't have to tell them how it happened, don't lie, and don't take an unsterilized knife to yourself.

tl;dr: guy came in with genital warts he tried to cut out of himself and gave him an infection.  He blamed it all on a vicious dog rape. ",CA[deleted],12,27:02.3

"Christians of Reddit: Many Christians are Christians because of the Bible/The Word. What determined your trust in the Bible as the word of God versus other religious texts such as the Quran, The Vedas, etc?",,18,6/13/2018 23:59,AskReddit,coffee_talks,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/8qwwfb/christians_of_reddit_many_christians_are/,/r/AskReddit/comments/8qwwfb/christians_of_reddit_many_christians_are/,8qwwfb,"I don't fit the profile you're looking for, but I hope you'll still skim this.

First, you're not supposed to trust the Bible as the authoritative word of God for any reason other than it claims to be. To do so would be granting it authority from another source and attribute God's power to something else. However, that does not mean other things do not corroborate the Bible.

From an archaeological standpoint, there are finds that match names and events mentioned in the Bible. Also there are enough copies of the New Testament that we can be confident that what the Bible says today is the same as what it said 2000 years ago.

From a personal standpoint, I've seen the effect it has on the people around me. When I got a C in college, my father threatened to disown me and kick me out. 4 years later, it's my brother's turn and he's terrified, so he tampers with the HTML to show he got straight A's. A semester later, wracked with guilt, my brother confesses. Instead of outrage, the first words out of my father's mouth were 'I forgive you'. My brother is not the favored child; such a dramatic change in behavior surprised my entire family. As for me, I see a lot of myself in what the Bible describes. Not the good things, the bad ones. The deceitfulness, stubbornness, arrogance, and pride. I clearly have the self\-justified attitude that the Bible condemns.

But what distinguishes the Bible from other religions is the message, a message written over 400 years and 40\+ authors, but remains consistent. Islam teaches that you must ask God for forgiveness and strive to be righteous, and He will overlook your sin and accept you into heaven. Hinduism that through discipline and devotion, you might liberate yourself from the cycle of life and death. Christianity teaches that no matter how hard you strive to be righteous, you cannot save yourself. (Who would want to be told that?) Instead, Christ exchanges his righteousness for your sin and pays the penalty for your rejection of God, so that you can be counted among the righteous. Everyone else teaches that you struggle to be good so that you can be saved. Christianity uniquely teaches that you become good because you have been saved.",CA[deleted],9,27:05.5

TIFU by locking myself in a bathroom.,"This event occurred a few hours ago so I am getting it down now while it's still fresh.

To begin I am a Senior in high school graduating later this week, currently it is ""Senior week"" a time in which my class does a variety of fun filled activities together (kind of like field trips but less supervised). Today we went to a popular amusement park in the area which is about a 3 hour drive from my high school. We took Coach buses to make the ride a bit more enjoyable and I was actually quite excited. The ride to the park was un\-eventful, he only part of the ride that was a bit strange was that the door to bathroom in the back of the bus would open and close with every twist and turn.

After a memorable day at the park we all filed into the buses and hit the road.

This is when the worst bus ride of my life began.

It started out fine, 2 hours and 15 minutes of normal bus ride until I had the sudden urge to relieve myself in the nearest facility. I made my way to the back of the bus and when I got into the tiny bathroom I closed the door behind me. The lock wouldn't engage so me being an immense idiot I pushed on it with all of my might. With a click my fate was sealed and I would be spending the remaining amout of my time on the bus inside of the broom closet I had dared to call a bath ""room"". 

After a few minutes I was finished doing my business and flushed the toilet. Once I washed my hands in the Tupperware container sized sink I turned to open the door by pushing up on the latch and sliding the door open. It took 15 minutes for me to give up but they were all panic filled. First I began pushing harder, and harder with each attempt fruitless. Brute force not working I took a closer look at the handle and realized the the instructions on how to open the door had been scratched off . This put two separate thoughts into my mind: Firstly I could just be really fucking stupid and don't know how to operate a door, or I was actually stuck in the bathroom of a coach bus that was full of my classmates. Not liking either of these possibilities I began scratching, yanking, pulling, ANYTHING to get out. After my 15 minutes of adrenaline fueled escape I caved. Knocking on the door into the bus I yelled ""Hey, I think I might be stuck in the bathroom"".

Word spread throughout the bus and the chaperoning teacher approached the door and began to try to jimmy the door open with a little do\-dad designed to open a locked coach bus door. Apparently in my idiotic panic I had broken the lock to the point of no return so the bus pulled over to the nearest rest station. Then a bus full of 12th graders, a bus driver, and a chaperone tried to play escape the room with a dumb ass on a toilet. 

Them: ""Is there anything you can use to leverage the handle""

Me: ""I got some toilet paper rolls""

Them: ""Try turning the nob""

Me:""What nob?""

Them:""The one for the door""

Me:""There ain't any nobs in here but the ones for the sink""

The questions continue for a while until I was told to ""Settle in for the rest of the trip to the school""

So after a painful 30 minute bus ride back to the school on the lid of a toilet we arrived and a janitor hammered the lock out.

I exited the bus and found around 20 of my classmates waiting to ensure I escaped my prison safely. Happy cheers erupted and much rejoicing was made. And that's how I made my way out of a very crappy situation.

TLDR \- I got stuck in the bathroom of a coach bus because I did a hulk smash.

TIFU by pushing myself so hard I got hypoxia,"Surprisingly, this did in fact happen today. Before I begin, I'd like to give a bit of background info: I'm in terrible shape and haven't exercised or been on a run in about 3 years.

My friend offered me to go running during the summer and I agreed, thinking why not? I need the exercise. We walked the first day, to familiarize myself with the route, no problems there. Today we actually went running. We got about halfway through when we reach the steepest part of the trail and we stop for a break. 

This part of the trail is at a 30 degree incline for about 200 feet and then there's a bench where it flattens out. My friend wanted to see how fast we can get up to the bench. Now, I had been pacing myself pretty well up until this point, but for some reason I decided to sprint right at the start. I understand that this is completely the wrong thing to do, but I just stopped thinking as soon as I started going. I sprinted for less than a minute and I was out of breath, but I still pushed myself even harder. I got to the bench and was so out of breath I barely got onto the bench. As I sat there, my vision was fading, I could barely hear my friend asking me if I was okay. I felt sluggish, dizzy, and lightheaded at the same time. Realizing that I had only gotten worse after sitting there for 10 minutes, my friend called his mom, who was a nurse, to pick us up and started carrying me up the rest of the trail. While I'm quite light, my friend had also just went up the steep incline. When we got to the top, his mother told me I got hypoxia, oxygen deficiency. She also pointed out I might have a heart problem and I should see a doctor...so decent first run.

Shout out to u/equinox9876 for carrying my ass up that brutal trail and saving my life.

TIFU by throwing my wallet away & thinking it was stolen,"My boyfriend (who’s letting me post this) likes reading me the Reddit thread ""Today I F****d up"" (TIFU), probably because it makes me feel better about my awkwardness and dumb situations I find myself in. SOOOO I have one to share today! 

I stopped by Target and decided to gather the trash from my car (this is a rarity). I was juggling my wallet, keys, and too many empty Starbucks cups (sorry planet). I threw the trash away and continued on. At checkout, I realized that I didn't have my wallet and boy did I lose it. 

My first inclination was that I must have dropped it so I retraced my steps and ask all the delinquent-looking teens if they had seen my wallet (""mmmhmm...likely story""). Then I frantically ran to the car to make sure I hadn't left it there. I decided to ask Guest Services if they had seen a wallet but they had not and called an associate to help me. I'm not sure if it was a particularly slow day at Target but soon I had a brigade of store associates pacing the aisles with me and firing me up that I had indeed been ""robbed."" They told me this had happened a few times that DAY already and that thieves are basically waiting for anyone to turn their back to steal from them. Soon I find myself on the phone with the police department and they are on their way over and Target's security team are fiercely ""reviewing the tapes"" and talking on their walkie-talkies with my personal team of wallet detectives. 

Soon the officer comes to take my statement (it's very official) and he proceeds to investigate the ""tapes"" with the security team. Finally, My boyfriend arrives probably because I was calling him over and over but why is he not surprised that I'm at Target with the police (this was not his first rodeo). The first thing he says ""are you sure you didn't throw it away"" and I stared back at him like ""how dare you accuse me of being an idiot"" but realized that it could be possible. He turns around and dives head first into the trash (okay, I'm being dramatic) and beneath the Starbucks cups he finds my wallet (for which has already been described in DETAIL in the police report). So now I'm all flustered and I yell ""nope that's not it!"" and start pulling him around to the dollar section so no one can see us. I'm yelling at him to go throw the wallet back in the trash (""I can't let the officer see it!!"") 
My boyfriend then tries to walk down the hallway to show the wallet to the police officer and security people while I'm physically pulling him back yelling ""nooooooo"" because here I am, trying to save my dignity and also my reputation because I love Target and want to be able to show my face here again. I finally get him to come back to hide in the dollar section as I'm scheming how to make my escape. (""Wait can I even do that!? Is that running away from a crime? Wait I called the police officers! But there's no crime! The Target people told me to!!!"") 
I didn't have enough time to plot my escape and the police officer comes back and I'm casually leaning on a cart, trying to play it cool. So then, of course, I just freak out wave my hands in the air yelling ""wooo!! We found it!! In the trash!"" He then seriously asks ""and how much was missing?"" So I previously had told him (in the official wallet thievery statement) a way higher number that I thought was in my wallet but actually wasnt... so either I’m go crazy or someone still did steal some. He then proceeds to tell me he's going to conduct a thorough investigation because he thinks he knows who did it. I told him that it wouldn't be necessary and I really appreciated his help and I was just happy I had my wallet. He insisted an investigation would need to happen. 

Right about now I just picture everyone watching the security tapes and finding me dumping my wallet into the trash.

TIFU by Falling for an Escort,"This was two  days ago. Recently went through a bad break up and have been feeling a  little down, as well as unable to keep my raging boner under control  (24M). Decided to spend an hour with an escort to make myself feel a  little more ok with moving on.

It turns  out, she is absolutely my perfect, ideal woman. I know what you're  thinking, an escort probably doesn't often scream out 'ideal woman' to  most men, but she absolutely is. She's a redditor, geeky gamer girl,  with what I'd call a perfect body. She is nice, understanding,  empathetic, funny, confident, cool, charming, witty and not to mention  the best sex I've ever had. We had so much fun and got on really well.

It's  a double edged sword because it showed me that there are definitely  more suitable women out there for me in the world. But she already has a  long term boyfriend outside of work so isn't interested in pursuing  anything else.

I've actually decided not  to see her again just because I don't want to blow my life savings on  something that's never going to happen in a manner that would suit me.

Any advice for a brother? :(

TIFU by doing donuts in front of a glass building,"Obligatory but this was several years ago but the photo popped up and Facebook and thought y’all needed a laugh. 

I worked at a small storefront by myself on weekends that got minimal traffic so I’d often get bored. One find Saturday I got the great idea to slide around like James Bond in my pick-up truck in the parking lot. There was loose gravel and dirt in the parking lot and I thought if I drive down the left side of the building real fast, stepped on the e-brake, make a hard right, floor it then stop I could park in my spot right in front of the building. It went perfectly in my head! I’d drifted around that corner a few times so I was confident I could drift, in a truck, using a foot e-brake, and land in my spot. Cake right? 

No. No cake was had that day. I came around the corner doing Mach 7, mashed the e-brake, released, and floored it, all as planned. BUT, when I went to hit the brakes, they didn’t work! The ABS had kicked in thinking I was on ice or something and froze my brake pedal! It just grinded as I went full speed right through the glass storefront. 

I called the bosses, who weren’t the least bit thrilled, meanwhile customers still showed up to witness my “grand opening”. Long story short we called a construction crew to board up the opening and I had to sleep in the store that night. And to my surprise I was promptly fired the next day...

TL;DR tried to hot rod my truck in front of my job and ended up driving though the building and subsequently was fired the next day after spending the night in the store.

"TIFU by drinking in a pool and almost drowning, then got grounded for ten months.","Forewarning that this fuck up didn't happen today, but I was reminded of it by a friend's drink.

In my teenage years, I spent summers with my father and school months with my mother. My mother is a staunch Catholic, refused to let me take sex-ed, and didn't teach me how to bathe because she considered that to be ""dirty.""

My father and my stepmother let me smoke pot from age 15 up, and let me drink from 16 and up, so long as I did either in their home. So my life was extremely different depending on where I was.

One day in mid-June my father, stepmother and I were on vacation. We were in a hotel pool relaxing and my father bought my stepmother an amaretto on the rocks. Now, my stepmother and father oftentimes let me try their drinks. This was the case on this occasion. My stepmom offered me the amaretto, which I'd never tried.

I had a habit of trying new things in moderation and instead of taking a drink, I took the small coffee stirrer stick and dipped it into the drink, placing my finger over the end to create a vacuum. I dripped the amaretto onto my tongue and found that I immediately disliked it. It tasted like NyQuil and licorice, both of which I hate.

I gave the drink back to my stepmother and began to swim toward the middle of the pool. Near the deep end, I began to feel funny. Like I couldn't catch my breath. I swam around a bit more, thinking it was temporary. But the sensation only started to spread to my throat.

After no more than a minute I felt as if someone was beginning to hug me very, very tightly. I was struggling to swim at this point and turned back to my family. I was barely able to doggy paddle back and took on quite a bit of water as I went back to them.

By the time I got back to them, barely able to cough, I felt as if a python were squeezing my upper chest and throat. I told them as well and as calmly as I could, ""I think I'm going into anaphylactic shock.""

They immediately decided that getting ticketed for giving alcohol to a minor was far more desirable than me dying, and so a few minutes later we were on our way to the hospital while I ""drank"" water (let it slide down my throat because I couldn't swallow properly). My father, bless his soul, acts before he thinks.

He called my mother and explained the situation before we even reached the hospital. First she screamed, then she cried, then she was doing both. However, the feeling eventually began to subside and by the time we were halfway to the hospital, I felt better. I had a raging headache and my chest hurt like hell from all of the water I inhaled, but I wasn't actively dying. In the end, I didn't need the hospital and we returned to the hotel.

But I still had to call my mother. I can honestly say that call was more terrifying than almost dying. But, I know it doesn't compare to what my mother was going through.

I was grounded until the next summer upon returning home. I had my laptop taken away, could not go out with friends, and she blocked most of the channels on television. For ten months my home was like Carrie without the physical abuse.

I didn't drink again until I moved out three years later.

TL;DR Drank liquor, went into anaphylactic shock, almost drowned, father fessed up, mother grounded me for ten months as punishment.

Edit: Yes, it was an allergic reaction. Hence the anaphylaxis. I am highly allergic to almonds. Weirdly enough as a child I had them maybe once or twice and immediately disliked them, so I suppose my body knew right away that I wasn't meant to have them.",0,6/14/2018 3:06,tifu,Adhara27,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8qy51k/tifu_by_drinking_in_a_pool_and_almost_drowning/,/r/tifu/comments/8qy51k/tifu_by_drinking_in_a_pool_and_almost_drowning/,8qy51k,So how did you fuck up? ,CA[deleted],2,27:27.8
TIFU by not wearing a shirt while fishing and getting painfully sunburnt,"Obligatory did not happen today. Happen this last Saturday. 

My dad and I went camping at a campground by a river about an hour from where we live. We set up camp on Friday, decided to spend all of Saturday in our kayak fishing the banks of a nearby lake, and Sunday morning we’d pack up and go home. Friday goes well, relaxed and enjoyed spending some time together, go to bed. 

Next morning we hop in the truck and go to the lake with our kayak. I decided I wanted to tan up a little bit so I only wear my bikini top, some shorts, and my new water shoes ( [kinda looks like this](https://goo.gl/images/W5RzZc) ). I put some SPF 50 spray sunscreen, a hat, and sunglasses and call it a day. 

Get to the lake around 9am, set up our fishing gear, get the kayak in the water, and proceed to mess around on the lake all day. Didn’t pull anything into the boat, but i did hook about a 3 pound large mouth bass (he threw the hook), lots of retrieving line from trees and logs tho. At about 12ish? we decide to have lunch so we pull our kayak up on the shore and take a break. At this point, i’m already kinda toasty. My knees are bright red from being exposed to the sun all day and my belly is pasty white (thanks to my life jacket). Go ahead and take a small swim to cool everything off, reapply my sunscreen, and eat some lunch. 

Now to where I really fucked up. 

Didn’t apply the sunscreen to my belly or chest because I assumed i would be wearing my life jacket. 

Go back out on the water and my legs are starting to really burn. Decide to take my life jacket off and put it over my legs to get the out of the sun, leaving my shoulders, chest, and belly totally exposed and with no sunscreen. Start heading back off the lake around 3:30ish and get back to the truck at 4:00 pm. I’m burnt af everywhere. Go to the water after we load the kayak to get some cold water on my burns. Takes some sting out, enough to go to the campground store. Mother fuckers charging $15 for aloe aftersun (same bottle costs $5 at walmart). Don’t give a fuck, buy it, put it on in the truck. Get back to camp and immediately change into sweatpants and a long sleeve shirt. Inspect the damage. 

Feet look like lizard scales
Knees are so burnt they’re swollen
Belly (which was virgin skin) looks like someone smacked it with a flyswatter
Shoulders tender, but they’ve already got crispy this year
Chest looks like a new shade of red lipstick

It’s been almost 4 days and no matter what tips the internet suggests to take out the burn, my belly screams in agony. Even my knees (who objectively got way more burnt than anything) are healing much better than my belly is. 

I’ve tried cold compress, i’ve tried cold showers, i’ve tried aloe, i’ve tried Tylenol, i tried the the “Excruciatingly hot shower to suddenly cold” showers— nothing is working. 

I’ve been walking around my house like some fat kid looking for food because i’ve been pulling my shirts up above my belly to prevent the skin front touching any skin. 

God is punishing me for my arrogance. 

Fml

TL;DR: Went camping, went out on a lake in a kayak with only a bikini top, shorts, some funky sandals, sunglasses, and a hat. Didn’t sunscreen properly and didn’t wear appropriate clothing. Sunburnt to high hell. It’s been about 4 days and my torment wont end.

TIFU by building a USB charging cable,"This actually did happen today, but it started yesterday. 

I'm a bit of a beginning hobbyist with electronics. I got a Raspberry Pi at an event earlier this year, and I've been working with that since then. I recently got my own soldering iron, and my adventures have gotten a bit more bold since then. Also, I'm a fucking idiot. 

So I was digging around for some parts, when I came across some old USB to who-knows-what cables. I've been researching how to splice USB cables for a while now, but I never really got started, since I didn't want to mess up one of the phone chargers that I still use. So I took this as an opportunity. 

Don't do this at home. 

The first thing I did was cut the weird end off the thickest cable. Inside, I found the exact four wires I had read about on Google. Perfect. So I went at it and isolated the two wires that I needed (if you're curious, I needed the two power cables. A USB has four pins: two for power and two for data. Each pin corresponds to a wire.). 

Again, don't do this at home. 

At this point, I have a USB to exposed wires cable. I plug the USB end into my sister's portable phone charger and the exposed wires to a DC motor. Now I can power a DC motor from a USB port. 

But of course I'm not done at that. ^(again, don't do this at home)

Now I decide that I have to *charge* the battery. So I get out an OTG adapter (plugs into a micro USB hole and has a regular USB hole) to make it easier on myself. I touch the exposed wires to the proper pins in the OTG adapter, and to my idiotic delight, the pack lights up. Sweet. 

BUT, as I'm taking the wires out, I must have touched them wrong. I saw electricity arc, and I knew something was off. Ten minutes later, I find out the battery won't stop heating up. I somehow shorted it. 

Shit. 

Soon, I started smelling a vague burning smell. I think the battery has gotten to that point. Basically, to prevent the house from burning down, I threw the thing in a Ziploc bag and dunked it in a sink full of ice water. I watched the stupid thing for an hour and a half to make sure it didn't explode. 

Don't fucking do this at home. 

The aftermath is, my sister won't talk to me, the Walmart battery recycling guy thinks I'm fucking nuts (which I probably am) and I have to buy a new power bank (I apparently burned her *good* one. Wooo.). Also, I've since attached a micro USB end to the cable to prevent such a mishap from happening again. The wires are still exposed because I never learn. 

TL;DR I tried to splice a custom USB power cable and shorted a power bank while testing it. Said power bank almost exploded and now many people think I'm insane and I have to buy a new power bank.

TIFU by thinking I could get some sleep at a John Mayer concert,"Mandatory this didn’t happen today. It actually happened 5 years ago, the summer between my senior year of high school and freshman year of college. Apologies that it is quite long.

That summer, I went on a mission trip to Belize. The trip was about a week long in a little town called Orange Walk. Having never been to Belize before, I didn’t anticipate the level of humidity (100% at the time) nor my ability to fall asleep in it. We spent most of our time working on a charity project during the day, then would hangout with the locals in the evening before going to bed. Bed. Ha. What a joke. Everyone else went to bed. I just laid in a puddle of sweat for 8 hours after dozing off for maybe 30 minutes or so.

And on this went. For a week. Running off of 1 hour to 30 minutes of sleep for seven days straight isn’t the best feeling in the world, especially when you’re working during the day. Now, I’m not one to complain. I understand tons of people have dealt with far, far worse in their lives. I drank coffee like a fish (I know, wrong analogy) which kept going until the day we left.

When the time came for us to board the plane, I knew it was nigh time I got some rest. As I sat down in row 31 on my flight to Dallas, I realized something. I’m one of those people who can’t fall asleep on planes. In fact, I need a bed, complete silence, and complete darkness. I’m high maintenance I suppose? Oh great. I remain zombified through this flight and another consecutive flight to Seattle. 

Me, being the party animal I am, had planned to attend the John Mayer concert at the Gorge (venue in Washington) that summer as well. And it started the day after I got back. My friends picked me up from the airport and we headed straight there. I believe it was around 6 or 7 in the evening at this point, and I knew it was finally time. I would get my sweet, sweet rest the night before the John Mayer concert.

Since I had come straight from my flight, I only had my things I had packed from Belize. Shorts, T-Shirts, and a cotton cocoon sheet for hot climates. But hey, the Gorge is 100+ degrees during the day, it will be just like Belize, right?

As we arrive and set-up our campsite, everyone was getting ready to party. I announced to my group of friends I’d be going to bed early that night, after a week of sleep deprivation. I promptly got into our tent right after we had set it up, and tucked myself into my cotton cocoon sheet, ready to drift off. Suddenly, I hear a truck pull-up next to our campsite blasting A$AP ROCKY's F**kin’ Problems. 

“Oh shit...” I thought to myself. And as I lay there sleep deprived, wishing the music would turn off, I finally fell asleep after laying there for nearly two hours listening to rap music. I was then jolted awake no more than a half hour later freezing cold. What the hell??? It was supposed to be hot as hell here. I piled some T-Shirts on top of me hoping it’d be enough to keep me warm. Still freezing, but curled up into a ball with t-shirts to make it bearable, I began to drift off again.

“MOOOO!!!” It turns out, our campsite was right next to a pasture of fucking cows that only like to moo at night. That was it. In a fit of rage and craziness, I storm out of the tent and frantically try to open my friend's car door to sleep in their car. It is locked and everyone is still gone partying. I race back to the tent, grab my friend's flashlight—a heavy mag one with a glass breaker like [this](https://shopsurvivalcat.com/collections/flashlights-lighting/products/9-in-1-multi-functional-roadside-flashlight-with-solar-panel-charging-bank-usb-port)—to light up my quest for my friend's keys to his car.

As I turn back from the tent and walk towards the car I trip and slam into the grass, whereas my face is gently cushioned by… dog shit. I sit up, take my shirt off and try and rub off as much dog shit as possible to clear my face before I vomit. As my nostrils repeatedly inhale the nastiness I look up to find that the glass breaker on the flashlight I was holding scraped alongside the front right side passenger door and cracked the window glass at the bottom.

As I am sitting in the grass my friends arrive to find me having vandalized the car and covered in dog shit.. At this point, I had accepted my fate. The universe wanted me to be awake and brutally punished me for attempting to sleep.

**TLDR**; Slept 1 hour per night on an international trip to Belize, go to John Mayer concert where a twist of events cause me to get covered in dog shit and vandalize my friend's car in my pursuit of sweet sleep.",94,6/12/2018 15:27,tifu,rushy_polar_bear,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8qjcox/tifu_by_thinking_i_could_get_some_sleep_at_a_john/,/r/tifu/comments/8qjcox/tifu_by_thinking_i_could_get_some_sleep_at_a_john/,8qjcox,Did you get any sleep yet?,CA[deleted],28,27:30.3
TIFU by Trying to Take a Shortcut Through the Parking Lot,"This happened just last night.

I was heading through the parking lot to my ride, which I can see isn't too far and is just past this little grass hill in the middle of the lot. This hill has a tree, some clover and grass, and a curb around it.

I, being the speed-walker I am, decide I'll just cut over this piddly little hill to get to the car. Well, the down slope of this hill is surprisingly steep. I slip a bit and then trip on the curb, landing smack on the left side of my face and glasses.

This, of course, busts my glasses to bits on top of digging the left hinge of my glasses into my face, centimeters away from my eye. On top of this, I scraped my knees (mainly my left) across the pavement.

I sit up and my glasses fall off and I realize I am bleeding from my head. A lot. Now, before that point I didn't think it was that big of a deal. It hurt, of course, but I thought it would be something I'd brush off. Felt real bad for breaking my glasses, but after seeing the sheer amount of blood pouring from my head I realized I should probably be more concerned about that.

So, a trip to the ER (which was thankfully less than five minutes away), a stitch, a gash on my left knee I can only describe as ""concrete burn,"" and a mild concussion later, I feel like a total idiot.

TL;DR I decided to cut through a patch of grass in a parking lot, ended up slipping, falling and breaking my glasses, as well as giving myself a slight concussion and a need for stitches.",21,6/12/2018 22:19,tifu,Poprorptop,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8qmr5y/tifu_by_trying_to_take_a_shortcut_through_the/,/r/tifu/comments/8qmr5y/tifu_by_trying_to_take_a_shortcut_through_the/,8qmr5y,Ouch!

TIFU by accidentally buying tickets to the Red Hot Chili Pipers not Peppers,"Few years back I was a bit drunk and saw online that the ""Red Hot Chili Pipers"" were playing in Edinburgh...I thought it was the Red Hot Chili Peppers! £30 for a ticket I thought it was a bargain! Bought two tickets one for me and one for my girlfriend (at the time).

I am a huge fan of the Red Hot Chili Peppers and I was super stoked to finally see them in Edinburgh! Most bands play in Glasgow so I couldnt believe my luck when I saw they were playing in my city!

So we turned up full of excitement really ready to get into the music and then I heard some bagpipe music was playing.

I thought hmm interesting...not what I expected from a warm up act but seeing as we are in Scotland and the capital city I really did not think it was anything out of the usual.

About an hour in I was getting a bit impatient, the music was great with good vibes but I was waiting for the Red Hot Chili Peppers to come out so I could do a bit of headbanging to some sweet guitar riffs!

I turned to the man next to me and asked when the Red Hot Chili Peppers were coming on he laughed and said ""aye pal good joke eh""

It was at this moment I realised I was not going to see the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

TL;DR: bought tickets to the Red Hot Chili Pipers thinking it was the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

TIFU by going to a festival and waking up in the stroke unit of a hospital the next day,"Before I start -- This didn't happen today, it was this past weekend. Also, please bear with me if I have some mistakes here and there, English isn't my native language. This is gonna be kinda long, so feel free to skip to the last paragraph for a tl;dr
Also if you think this is important, I'm M19. :)

Anyways, let's start on friday morning, 8am. We meet up to get our bus ride to the festival that's happening around 500km from where I live. Because we're all in a good mood I already had my first beer. 
Fast forward several hundred kilometres and I'm having my 7th beer bong (I started drinking alcohol like 6 months ago only, I still can't really estimate what amount is much and what isn't). After like 10 hours we finally arrive and I'm feeling well so far. Thruth is, I don't remember anything that happens 15 minutes after we arrived at the location.

Next day, 6am. I wake up, laying in a bed, my shirt was taken off and I have electrodes put on my torso, there are some elderly men lying left and right to me. You don't know how confused I was, like wtf man, I'm supposed to be wake up in a tent, not in a bed. Where is my shirt? Where are my friends? Where AM I? On further inspection of my surroundings, I also can't find my phone or glasses, which sucks a LOT. Anyways, a doctor comes in and tells me apparently I had an epileptic seizure and was brought to this hospital for monitoring. I'm just like ""wtf when did that happen"" because, as I mentioned, I don't remember anything. 

Time passes by as I'm lying on my bed thinking about what happened and what I can do about this. I come to the conclusion that I have to go back to the festival to find out what exactly happened the last 12 hours. The doctors want to do some tests with me though so they send me to the radiology to do an MRI. 

So the thing here is, it's ok, I apparently had a seizure. But I'm also hella hungover. I lay down in this tube, not knowing what to expect from this MRI. Time doesn't seem to pass at all and I start feeling my stomach rumbling and all I hope is I can make it out of this tube before bad things happen. Spoiler alert: I didn't make it out in time, resulting in me puking all over this big ass thing and also myself, and my shirt, which I put on again. Bad thing for me, I forgot to pack in a 2nd shirt for me when I had the seizure, so I wore a scrub shirt for the rest of the day.

I get brought up to the stroke unit again and ask for a towel so I can take a shower. Still, my only thoughts were that I had to get out of this hospital and get back to the festival. After some more waiting feat. me puking out my lunch (some kind of soup) I get transferred to another, non-stroke unit room. I then ask to get discharged from the hospital, because in my eyes I was only losing time. Doc told me I had to sign some form saying this was against the Doc's recommendation. I do it.

Remember that I'm still wearing the scrub shirt. As I don't have my phone with me, I ask the lady at the reception how far away the location of the festival actually is, finding out it's apparently about 60km. Well fuck. She then gets suspicious about some dude walking out in a scrub shirt which is really fair tbh. Anyways, after some talking and discussing we decide the best option for me is to take a train to a nearer village and then take a taxi from there. I do it. It costs me like 60€ (Luckily I had my ID, health insurance card and bank card with me).

I arrive at the festival, wearing a fucking scrub shirt, completely dehydrated and hungry, just looking for answers. I finally find my friends who are reaaally relieved to see me. And they told me what happened.

Apparently I saw a beer bong right when we got on the festival and drank it. And then I just kinda lost control over my body, so much that my friends brought me the first aid team. They told my friends they can pick me up in like 3 hours when I'm feeling better. Except I wasn't there anymore when they got back and nobody could tell them where I was. My friends get the police to talk to the first aid team and they find out which hospital I'm at the next day, only for them to find out I had left the hospital like an hour ago or so. So yeah, there's that.

This whole thing really blows because i.e. I'm not allowed to drive anymore amongst other things. Also, as aspiring medical doctor (lol the irony) I need to have a occupational disability insurance at some point, which gets a lot more expensive for people diagnosed with epilepsy, so I have to get that shit done ASAP. And worst of all, I missed half the festival.

TIFU by almost killing myself in my sleep,"Apologies that this is quite long, skip to the TL;DR if you want a reason to continue reading.

I should preface this story by saying that I have long had a history of sleepwalking, sleep-talking, and generally not being a very agreeable nighttime companion. Often, my antics are correlated with sleeping in a new environment; and I once read that when you sleep somewhere new your brain is only partially asleep so I have chalked this up as an explanation. Previously, for example, when camping I sleep-punched my friend in the head when we were sharing a tent together. New beds sometimes makes me do stuff idk. 

The day before yesterday was my first day back home from University since Christmas, and I spent the evening drinking with my parents. At around 12 we decided to go to bed and so I went up to my room. Glass of water. Phone on charge. Clothes off. Bedtime. This is a room that I haven't slept in for over 5 months. Cue sleepwalking.

My memory of exactly what happened is hazy, but the next thing I remember is it being very dark, very painful, and me being very naked and confused on the concrete patio a storey below my bedroom window. I remember touching the back of my head and having it come back covered in blood, which put me in complete shock. My first instinct was to try and get back into the house, but all the doors were locked. I tried to break into the house by smashing one of our sliding glass doors with a metal chair but was embarrassingly unsuccessful. So I decided to climb over the neighbour's two fences and run into the street to get help. I should have just rung my own doorbell to wake up my parents, but the bang to my head had made me forget that they were even home. I ran down the street to the only house with the lights still on and frantically knocked on the door.

To my 17-year-old neighbour who answered the door to a scary confused naked man covered in blood in the early hours of the morning, I am incredibly grateful that you let me in your house. I don't actually remember very much of what happened immediately here but I know that she put me into a onesie, called an ambulance for me, and gave me a tea towel to hold to the back of my head. I eventually remembered that I had spent the evening with my parents, so the girl ran down the street to fetch them. To nobodies surprise it took mum and dad a little while to process finding me bleeding and concussed in a tiger costume at a neighbour's house a few hours after saying goodnight.

Anyway, the ambulance came, I had a CT scan, stitches in the back of my head, some treatment for the cuts and bruises on my back and sprained ankle, but luckily I am ultimately okay. Nevertheless, I am kind of terrified. This has definitely been the closest that I have ever come to death and I dread to think what would have happened if I had broken my neck. My dad installed a lock on my window now so that it only opens a couple of inches, which I find fairly reassuring. But I can't shake the feeling that my subconscious tried to kill me. For now though, I live to browse reddit another day.

TL;DR: Sleepwalked out of my window and gave a minor a nighttime naked surprise.

TIFU by pushing open a door with my foot.,"This didn't happen today, but on Monday 2 weeks ago.

What you need to know beforehand: On my uni-free days, I work at a grocery store at the cash checkout. At work, when you go to the staff rooms, you have to go up a flight of stairs and open one of those self-closing doors which is rather heavy.

I was on my way to lunch break and didn't have my hands free as I was carrying my cash drawer and my water bottle along with other miscellaneous stuff. Thus, I was glad that someone just came out of that heavy door so I wouldn't have to open it. Logically, since my hands were occupied with carrying stuff, I decided to push open the door with my foot as I have done countless times before. Unlike all the other times, however, immediately as I pushed open the door my hip joint cracked (which it had done before too, but not like this) followed by a surge of pain in my hip. This left me barely able to put weight on my right leg.

Two days later, and the pain got worse, so I went to a doctor. Apparently me pushing open the door was enough to strain a muscle in my hip. I've been walking on crutches for the past two weeks now, without much relief from the pain.

TIFU by accidentally bringing bullets to the airport.,"TSA and the airport police did a great job overall. 

They spotted 10 bullets in my backpack when it went through the machine. I knew as soon as I saw the look on the guy’s face that was reading the screen that I had goofed. They were calm, I was calm, and the guy said there wasn’t anything to worry about but I had to wait for the police to talk to me and collect the bullets.

The police arrived and were very chill. They ran my id to make sure I had no outstanding warrants, and he told me where I could pick up my bullets after they get processed. 

No criminal issues and TSA doesn’t fine for anything less than 50 bullets so I ended up only losing 20 minutes on the whole.

Great experience for such a silly mistake.

Lessons to be learned:
1.) ALWAYS check your bags
2.) stay calm and be polite
3.) show up at least 30 minutes early to your flights

TL:DR forgot I had left bullets in the backpack I used to travel and the TSA and police were polite and professional.

TIFU by Rube Goldberging my college payment,"Hi, this is my first post on Reddit. I've never felt an urge to post anything...before this blunder on Monday. 

I'm highschool senior about to go into college, and the deadline to pay for classes was coming up, so like a sensible person, I waited until the second to last day to pay for them. Usually I do stuff last minute, a terrible habit, but in my poor defence, when I tried to pay the college last Friday, it turns out that these guys close on Fridays, dang it. So, because I had work during the weekend, I decided to try again on Monday. live far from the college. It takes around an hour to bike from my house to the Bart station and then to the college. So, I woke up super early on Monday and started for the college. Before I left, I checked my stuff, bike and a fat stash of money, looks good. Buuuuttt, as I found out not 10 seconds after I walked into the college, indicated by the sign, I needed a photo ID. Welp, this is a problem, cause I only have my bike and my fat stash of money, so the college dude told me that the computer people could help me with online payment. In my head I remembered when I tried it last time, I had played a whole League of legends game and the thing was still processing. But I really didn't want to head back home so I decided to try it out. Unfortunately it didn't work, same thing, taking forever to process, so I grumbled and went home. An hour later, I came back 30 mins before closing and hurriedly showed then my ID...it was acceptable, YES! Showed then my fat stash of gold...*Dial up noise*...Boom, failed.    The college people said their machine wouldn't take my card...you what?! So I rushed outside to call my bank and what they told me made me feel like one of those customers that brings in their computer to an IT dude and the IT dude tells him, you forgot to turn on the computer sir. At this point, I vaguely remember transferring most of my money to savings, and only around $200 was left...wait a minu...huh...ahhhh...no wonder I couldn't pay for my classes online. By the time I got back inside the building, they had already closed, so instead of waiting till' the next day, I just skipped all the trouble by paying for it online.

TLDR: I did alot more work to pay for college than I had to",3,6/14/2018 5:34,tifu,c0deforg3r,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8qz1ie/tifu_by_rube_goldberging_my_college_payment/,/r/tifu/comments/8qz1ie/tifu_by_rube_goldberging_my_college_payment/,8qz1ie,CB[deleted],CA[deleted],CS[deleted],46:11.4
TIFU by crashing the work car into my other boss's van,"OK so this happened on Sunday night at work. In the weekends I do a part time job at a Thai and Chinese place, mainly just doing the deliveries. Sometimes I will do other duties there but my main priority is getting the food out to people. The chef owns a Honda odyssey which is worth about $400 so a older, cheap run around for this kind of work. My boss owns a van (which is pretty expensive) that he uses to ferry people/goods to the city which is a 90 minute drive from here. Sunday I was doing the usual, it was busy since we're the only take away that does deliveries. I came back to the shop and there was a free park in the car park and me being me I thought I could squeeze in as it's quicker and easier. I try and then I hear a ""BANG"" and I've hit the boss's van by the back right wheel and the car on the left top wheel. Luckily it's minor damage, soft scratches on the van and a dent in the front bonnet of the car. The boss heard it so I told the truth, and I offered to pay the excess for the repairs but the chef didn't mind since the car was old. I was lucky I didn't hurt anyone and didn't get fired. Thought it would be fun to share my fuck up though.

TIFU losing my passport overseas,"So this happened not that long ago, but it has made me a smarter traveler.  

I had a friend and she lived overseas in Egypt for a semester for school. We are both from Canada, and I haven't been to very many places so I thought it would be cool to fly out and visit her towards the end of the semester when she was coming home. The plan was to hang out in Egypt for a week, and then hang out in Europe for a week. When I flew to Egypt I saw the Pyramids, Sphinx, and just had an overall great time .. for the first two days. I then got deathly ill from food poisoning and spent the remaining 5 days in the bathroom and in bed. She was fine because she got to spend time with some guy she had the hots for.  

Queue flying to Europe \- I was starting to feel better, but she was miserable because she had to leave her new ""boyfriend"". I was just excited because neither of us have been around Europe and it would be fun to explore. We flew from Cairo to Amsterdam and took a taxi to our private room in the heart of the red light district (which cost me an arm and a leg). She was just moping the whole time and literally just wanted to sit and read/text her guy. So I went off exploring, hitting bars and coffee shops, even hopping on a train to Belgium. By the last day I was furious.. I went all this way to hang out with her and I was literally by myself 95&#37; of the time. I had a bunch of her bags I was carrying on the way to the airport and she made a snappy comment and I lost it. I dropped all of her shit down and got in a blow up argument with her in the middle of this busy street in Amsterdam. After about 10 minutes, we picked everything up and started walking to the train station. I felt for my passport and it wasn't there. I dropped everything, and rummaged through everything and nothing. Went and retraced our steps, nothing. Our room, nothing.  

Best logical choice? Go to the airport, we had a flight in 2 hours. After a bunch of explaining they sent us to the police station to file a report (all in dutch). They said it should be fine and I should get on my plan no problem. I showed the dutch paperwork to the lady working for the airline, she said ""oh okay thats fine, printed out my boarding pass and checked my luggage"". I managed to get through 3 check points in the airport with this piece of paperwork in dutch. We relaxed, decided to spend the rest of our money on gifts for family. It was a full flight so we didn't have seats together. There was a mens line and a womens line while boarding to get searched or something. The mens was longer so I said ""see you in canada"" to my friend as we were not sitting together. She got on the plane, when it was time for me to get searched he asked for my passport and said this paperwork would not do it. The plane took off, leaving me with no money, no baggage and alone.     
Some nice European guy told me I needed to get to The Hague, which was an hour away. I ended up jumping on a train without buying a ticket. Luckily I got away with it. I then ended up hitchhiking and got a ride straight to the canadian embassy by some nice dutch hippy guy. The people at the embassy got me an emergency passport and ended up getting me a ticket for a flight in 2 days. Ended up eating condiments from the airport, washing my clothes in the sink of the bathroom and going full Tom Hanks in 'Terminal', without the hot dates with Catherine Zeta Jones. To top it off, the flight back I had some woman in front of me recline her chair back for the worst 10 hour flight I've ever been on.. Oh and my luggage was stolen in Canada. That was cool too.  

TL;DR \- Lost my passport in Europe, ran out of money and was alone. Hitchhiked to embassy. Lived in Airport for 2 days. Luggage stolen.",420,6/11/2018 8:33,tifu,SurrealEffects,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8q7oai/tifu_losing_my_passport_overseas/,/r/tifu/comments/8q7oai/tifu_losing_my_passport_overseas/,8q7oai,"Damn dude, was there anything valuable in your luggage?",CA[deleted],104,46:26.8
TIFU by bringing an air soft gun to school,"This immense fuck up occurred several years back during my Sophomore year of high school. I want to preface this story by making it clear that I’m not nearly as stupid as the following events might suggest.

During my Sophomore year, I joined the cross country team. I had a lot of friends in it, and the coaches were all really relaxed, kind people. While I wasn’t overly fond of running, I did enjoy the practices and races. 

Our practices were always at the nearby elementary school’s football and track field, as it was bigger than any field at the high school. At least once a week we’d get to run through the trail in the woods near the school. That was always my favorite run, as it was scenic and beautiful. Every Thursday we were able to choose where we run, and I always chose those woods.

One thing you’d always see in the woods were air soft pellets, all over the ground. It always seemed like a fun place to have an air soft war, as there was plenty of cover and places to hide.

Cue the fuck up.

The collective brilliant minds of myself and my friends decided to coordinate an air soft fight that would take place on a Thursday during our free run. It was supposed to be the Sophomores versus the Freshmen, and we were all excited about it. Our practices occurred after school, but since I didn’t have a car, I couldn’t run home and get my gun, so I had to bring it in my backpack. 

The day comes, and I bring my gun to school, but never take it out for obvious reasons. Class ends, and I head over for practice. After some light stretching, we were able to go on our merry way, so my dumbass friends and I ran to the woods and begin our little war.

So, we’re running around, having a jolly old time, shooting one another with our guns, until one of my best friends accidentally runs by a coach while holding his air soft gun. The coach asked why he had a gun, and my buddy ran off. 

We quickly dispersed, and our short conflict came to an end.

Fast-forward to the next day, while I’m sitting in health class. The teacher gets a call, and I get a sick instinctive feeling like the call was meant for me. It was. I was summoned to the vice-principal’s office, who was in charge of discipline. The vice-principal was a wicked woman who only lasted a year at my school. She was a total bitch who made sure everyone called her Dr. because she had a PhD in Education. Basically, Dr. Bitch asked if I had been involved in an incident involving guns on school property. I was raised to be honest, so my dumbass told the truth.

After being escorted to my locker, having it searched by the school officer, and then being locked in a white-walled room, I was called into Dr. Bitch’s office once more.

I was suspended from school for a week, and had to sit there as the wicked witch of my high school called my mom. She was furious with me. That was not a fun conversation.

While a suspension might not seem terrible, it had a lot of consequences I wasn’t prepared for. For starters, I wasn’t able to be on school grounds for a week, and they wouldn’t even let me take the bus home, so I had to walk. I wasn’t able to attend my brother’s senior night soccer game which was really important to him. I couldn’t participate in the next two cross country meets. I was informed that I’d have to put the suspension on any college applications, and the National Honors Society barred me from joining.

Perhaps worst of all, is the whole incident looked really bad for the head coach, who was a really kind, fun, and supportive guy. He was the head coach for many years, but that was his last year being involved with the team. I am almost 100% certain the administration forced him out.

I’ve always been a really good kid in school. Got solid grades, was always highly respectful of teachers and other students, but this one fuck up smeared an otherwise clean school record. 

Don’t bring guns to school kids.

TL;DR: My friends and I brought air soft guns to the school woods to have a little war during our cross country practice. A coach caught us, reported it, and I was suspended from school and faced many consequences.

EDIT:
Thank you to everyone who shared their experiences and similar stories! It was fun to read and talk with you all! Also apologies to anyone who is offended by my liberal usage of the word “bitch.” By all accounts, the vice principal fit the bill of someone who could easily be characterized by that word, regardless of gender. She had zero interest in helping us become better students. 

EDIT 2: 
Ok I’m definitely a dumb ass for putting my suspension on my college applications. The vice principal told me upon suspension that it was something that colleges needed to know about, and I guess I never questioned that until now.

TIFU by riding a bike on woodchips,"This happened around 15 minutes ago and it still hurts. I'm staying at a friend's house and we decide that we need to go to the local supermarket to get a bit of food. The place is a bit over a mile away and my friend has 2 bikes so naturally we take the bikes. Being the incredibly impatient people we are we are riding really fast and taking corners faster than we should have. There is one corner that has a little bit of pavement in front of a small garden of woodchips. As I'm turning I end up on the woodchips and my back wheel slides out from underneath me. I start to fall forward and my dick lands right on the end of the handlebar. It hurts but i am able to get back up and get back on the bike. My friend and I laugh about it for a while before we take off again. As I am riding I feel a small breeze going over my balls. I stop and it hits me before I even look.

I ripped my jeans.

I was then forced to ride back which is where I find myself, a friends house with jeans that have a 6 inch hole starting from my dick going down the inside of my leg.

TL;DR: I fell off my bike and ripped open my jeans where my dick is.

"TIFU by getting sunburned, overdosing, and going deep sea fishing","Obligatory this didn't happen today. 

Back about two months ago for spring break I decided to go to Cancun because I needed some sun after the eternal winter the US had this year which was great in theory but you see, I was pasty white at the time due to the aforementioned winter. To remedy this I went tanning, but because I'm an all or nothing type person I decided to tan three days in a row for the max time in the top of the line bed which wasn't supposed to be as harmful for my skin. I tanned and I didn't think much of it until I realized that after the third time my nose had gotten a little pink but I assured myself I was fine otherwise. 

Fast forward to the flight in and I began to realize that something was amiss with my skin. I itched everywhere and couldn't get away from it. Turns out in my tanning boom I got a type of sunburn called hell's itch and in my frantic search for something to help I found some benadryl in my bag and took two tabs to try to get the itch to die down. Placebo effect or not it certainly felt like it helped and I was on my way.

Fast forward two days of me being stuck indoors with the damned itch as not to irritate it and taking more benadryl every single time it flared up. By this point I was so done with not doing anything in Mexico and I booked a deep sea fishing trip for the next day to kickstart my spring break, albeit a little late. 

After another late night of using benadryl to get me de-itched enough to sleep I was up at stupid o'clock to go catch my boat. On the taxi ride there my driver recommended we stop at a 24 hour pharmacy to pick up dramamine - a great idea! Popped two of those bad boys before I got on the boat and then one after since I tend to get motion sick anyways and I was feeling ready to go.

I caught a nap on the hour ride (important) out to our spot and remember waking up in some insane kind of brain fog but brushed it off as a result of not getting enough sleep the nights prior but put it out of my mind because we had arrived and the lines were in the water. Awesome. About fifteen minutes and a bait fish or two later my legs start cramping and I fall face first onto the deck and seized. Of course, the lines were pulled and the crew went as fast as they could to get me back to shore where an ambulance was waiting but in the hour it took to get there I had three more seizures (that I'm aware of) and lost consciousness. 

I woke up in the hospital some hours later with the realization that I basically hadn't stopped taking benadryl for almost three days and threw a bunch of dramamine on top of it and the doctors were telling me that my scans didn't indicate much permanent damage and I very well could have died. 

TLDR- I wanted to get tan for spring break and set into motion a chain of idiocy that ended with seizures on a boat an hour away from land.

TIFU by giving a street musician all my money,"So, I'm in Europe on business, the business of picking up the MacGuffin of a pink Fendi purse from a bar in Paris.  But, I thought it'd be a good idea to stop by Amsterdam on the way over and buy some magic truffels.  I wasn't planning on taking them, but as soon as I got to Paris some unknown force compelled me to take half the bag.  So, I'm trippin' balls and I meet up with a fellow redditor.  We're on the subway, and I'm saying something about how every moment can be interpreted or experienced on a scale from 1 to 10.  1 being blackout drunk and 10 being holy perfection.  We get off the subway.  He's wearing a Led Zeppelin t-shirt, and I start saying something about Jimmy Page's guitar.  We turn the corner and get on an escalator and as we're ascending, Stairway to Heaven starts playing (or was already playing).  Now, my first thought was that they just always play that music because the opposite would just be too coincidental.  But, no, we round some corners and there is a classical guitarist playing a Yamaha silent guitar.  I know because I've owned one, but I'm not even counting that as part of the coincidence.  And, he looked *just* like Terrance McKenna, famed magic mushroom guru.  I was absolutely convinced that this was a revelation because not only was all this going on, but I also seemed to go into some trance, too.  And, it's happened to me before.  You just feel like you're in the center of the universe, and you are because everywhere is the center of the universe.  There is something weird going on.  

Anyway, I was convinced that God was playing through this musician, but I wanted him to know that.  There just happened to be one other person there, who happened to speak English and said she could translate.  So I had her tell him that he was playing the music of heaven and being controlled by God.  I feel like that's something every musician should aspire to.  To show him I was completely serious I gave him all the money I had on me, a substantial sum, probably like 100+ euros.  I also gave the girl 10 euros.  Now, I'm in Cannes and I wish I had that money to spend on food.

TIFU by drying my Drumsticks,"I'm not really native when it comes to english, but here goes.

I really love my drumsticks, I really like my drum sticks, so even though it breaks, I'll just wrapped it up with an electrical tape. It's been with me through my ups and downs. It gave me the confidence that in every hit, a tone resonating my inner emotion would sprung up. Metal, Jazz, J\-Pop, you name it, it will play it. After a lot of hitting and bashing, the electrical tape, the only thing that is holding it together, broke. It made me really sad. But I know, that even the most sensitive things can be fixed. So, I had to wrap it with a new one. With my luck, I found an electrical tape, and I had to fix my sticks. I then removed the old tapes, and I found the sticks to be sticky. I went to the sink to wash the sticks to remove the sticky stuff. I planned to sun dry my sticks and then wrap it so it would be good as new, but then it rained. I had to dry it quick so it doesn't rot. And then, I made the best decision of my entire life. 

I remembered that we have a microwave oven. Back when I just had it, I remember putting in foods and stuff, and then all the moisture of the food will be gone, and I know that it would do the same way on my Sticks. ""Well, removing the moisture inside the sticks will surely do it."", I said to myself. I then went, and put the sticks inside. It won't fit, so I had to hold the sticks inside and push the door quickly. I set the oven to high, and then watched some ""Forged in Fire"". After a while, I remembered that I am actually forging a new stick inside our microwave oven. I then saw fire and smoke inside the oven, and then I smiled. ""I fucked up"", the words I said to myself while opening the oven doors. The oven smells like a smoke house. The oven is almost set ablaze by my idiocy, as with our house, I'm happy that it didn't come to that. My sticks has parts, burnt black, and piping hot. I cooled it, and held it, and I know that it would still work. I then hit our table with the stick, not knowing it would be the last strike. As the charred pieces broke and fell on the floor, my heart made the same move. My hand tried to remember every fleeting moment that they were together. And in that moment, I knew, I had to say goodbye.. Good bye.

TIFU by spilling water on the floor.,"Obligatory this happened 30 minutes ago.

Today was a great day. Woke up early with plenty of sleep, exercised with a friend, created a simple program on the computer to test myself. Overall you can see I had a nice day, hanging out with friends and had some success.


Night time came, I ate really tasty chicken with rice and my brother pointed that the toilet bin is full of toilet paper. Now for the people not familiar with this in some countries instead of throwing the paper of my doom inside the toilet we throw it inside a trash can which later we empty. 


Then the fuck-up began.

I proceeded to try to remove the bag with the paper which was stuck. I pulled, it pulled back and no success, until I pulled it hard enough to throw some of the dark matter on the air and it was heading right on my hand. Having quick reflexes from watching too much Anime  (anime makes you expect the unexpected for anyone that didn't know) I quickly evaded it but to my surprise I hit something. You see we have a pipe that transfers all the water used in the washing machine to the bathtub but since we haven't used it in about a week the water got really dirty. That's what I hit. The pipe with really, really dirty water inside. The smell was bad... the worst kind of bad. Like a thoudand demons ate 8 month old eggs with rotten cheese and shitted it. It. Was. Disgusting. Tried to use chlorine to mop it but I couldn't even get inside the bathroom. Finally I used paper soaked with alcohol to try and neutralize the smell. Spoiler: it didn't work.

Finally I mustered up the courage to mop it. I managed to mop the floor but the smell was still there, still incredibly bad.

TL;DR: Spilled dirty and smelly water on the bathroom floor and I opened a portal to fucking hell.

TIFU by putting my monitor in the car standing up instead of lying down,"tl;dr It fell over and now part of the panel is damaged

I have a very nice 4k monitor, solid $350 ish when I bought it. It's served me well this past year and a half, got it in Sept of 16 and honestly it's like the one thing that's given me no issues.

I went to a friend's house for 4 days, figured I'd bring my rig (the tower is light and easy to carry) and he suggested the monitor as well, not that it was in any way his fault. I've brought my stuff to and from university a few times, so I figured it'd be okay. On the way there, no worries. The entire time there, no hiccups.

Then this morning it was raining and I rushed to get it into the car, not thinking about optimal placement. I had it standing up in his fairly massive (suv with rear seats folded) trunk space. Well like 5 minutes from my house he brakes kinda suddenly (again not his fault) and it tips, smashing into the side of the car. He immediately, like i m m e d i a t l y  starts saying that if anything's broken it's my fault. I of course keep saying yes, my heart racing.

I get home, there's a few marks that I'm able to wipe off. So no biggie, thought I, it's all good in this hood. I got all the stuff inside, and noticed there were still a few drops on things so I let it dry. As in, I ate and napped and played on my phone. I just a few minutes ago plugged it in to see if it was fine, and there's a spot that's blue and fairly bright, instead of the all black of the regular monitor startup. 

I know my dad feels the same way, we both hate this stuff. Haunts us for years. I lost a crucial piece to a 50 ish dollar toy (snap circuits jr) and needed to hide it to get my mental health back on track. We're not poor, but certainly not able to break things every day. I don't even know how to feel right now. I usually don't let myself have nice things for these exact reasons. Cheapest pocket knives because I figured I'd ruin it (that's another story, still 90% fine), cheap phone cables because I abuse them, point is I'm not happy, Bob, not happy.

I know it's stupid because it's a material possession and all that, but seriously I can't afford to just replace it.

tifu by microwaving my lunch,"This is one that actually happened today, I am house sitting for my sister while they are on vacation, its ok, let dogs out every now and again and make sure nothing catches on fire. I fucked one of those things up, that's for sure. 

I left to take my lunch break, and with no time I stopped at a fast food place and grabbed a burger and fries, and halfway there I get stop by a ~20 minute train, and I only get an hour for lunch. 
So by the time I drove out to their house my food was cold, and I was running short on lunch time. I get inside, toss the bag in the microwave to bring it back up to an enjoyable temperature and turn it on for 30 seconds. I walk away to let the dogs outside, and as I turn around to call them to me, I see sparks and flames inside of the microwave. I sprinted back to the microwave and grabbed the flaming bag out of it, and tossed it in the sink and ran water over it. The inside of the microwave is covered in dark brown burn marks, and NOTHING touches it, magic erasers, a scrub brush, brillo pads, nothing. So now I'm either going to have to face the music and buy them a new microwave, or figure out some way to get it sparkling clean.

TIFU by bringing a pocket knife to school,"Tl;dr: I dropped a pocket knife in chem class, said it was mine, and got suspended for 5 days.

Obligatory: this was not today, rather about 6 months ago give or take

Also, typed on iPhone so stfu

So I’m a Boy Scout, and I’m an avid knife enthusiast. I call if that anyways, and over last summer, I went to the national jamboree. After a week long trip, I had traded patches for SO MANy knives, but the only one I really liked was this small knife, about the size of a credit card that folded up. I’ll attach a picture.

So fast forward to a couple months after the Jamboree, I had been carrying this credit card knife in my pocket. Months of doing so, actually caused me to kinda forget about it. This is where the tifu begins. I was also fresh from the dmv, after getting my temporary license, and I showed it to a friend in my chemistry class. Somehow, in doing so, the credit card knife fell out of my wallet, and onto the ground.

I didn’t notice this happen, and I went on to Bands Of America in Indianapolis. Our school’s band goes every year, and all the band kids miss a day or two of school. When I returned from BOA, I got called into the office about halfway through the day, and was escorted there by the assistant principal. Apparently they had interviewed and asked everyone in the vicinity of where I sat, in all classes leading up to mine, leaving the knife to be identified by me.

He sits me down in his office, and pulls out this knife from in his desk. 

Assistant A-Hole: “OP, do you recognize this knife?”

My Dumbass: “Yeah, I was wondering where that went”

Assistant A-Hole: “Do you realize how serious of a matter this is?”

Me: “Umm, no.”

He then proceeded to call my parents, and tell them both that I was suspended for 10 days, pending expulsion once brought up to the school board, for bringing a deadly weapon onto school grounds. I call BS, but I want to avoid more trouble. Because it’s a small district, my family knows the superintendent pretty well, so after some work and an extensive hearing, my sentence was cut in half. 

So long story short, don’t bring a pocket knife to school. If doesn’t work out well.

TIFU by hitting my own thumb using hammer,"I am one of those guys who easily gets fainted by seeing my own blood, also not 5 seconds after injuring myself i can get fainted on the spot, so today my father and I decided to work on a project that we have been doing for the last month, which is building a wooden gazebo structure in front of my house. Today is the day where we were about to install the roof, and while nailing the roof bracket, i accidentally hit my thumb and immediately felt like to faint. (Keep in mind that i am at the roof of the gazebo which are almost 3 meters tall). Next thing I know i am at the ground lying there holding my hand and shaking while my brother wake me up, I literally felt like I was asleep, I even had a dream for about 2/3 seconds falling, and now I'm in bed holding the pain in my back hoping tomorrow that all is going to be OK.

TIFU by getting coffee stains all over the roof of my car,"So this happened to me a few years ago, August of 2014. I was a month away from being shipped off to basic training and my best friend was in town visiting me for a few weeks. When he first got there i went and picked him up at the airport in my moms car, after picking him up we went and got coffee from the drive through at Starbucks. Fast forward a few weeks and i am driving him back to the airport, were goofing around in the car being idiots, and i notice that the coffee cups are still chilling in the cup holders, so like the dumb 18 year old I was i grab the cup of coffee and throw it out the window, only the window was rolled up. so as I'm driving down the highway this halfway full old coffee cup explodes on the inside of my moms car... the next year my parents end up giving me that car as a late graduation present. Now whenever i drive, i am constantly reminded of what an idiot i was. I guess that is just karma for trying to litter!

TIFU by getting hyped up for a concert that I missed by a month,"**The Pledge:** So, I was browsing concerts a few months ago, and I love animal collective, but their tickets are usually pricier then I'd like. I decided I would settle for just Panda Bear, 25 bucks versus ~60 for the whole gang, not bad, and I loved his latest album PBMTGR so what the hell. I marked it down in my calendar along with a prospective Grizzly Bear concert. Bought the tickets for Panda Bear, printed them out because my phone isn't too reliable. I put the ticket out in the open on my desk. Now I just wait a few months, ticket is unlosable on my desk, concert is marked in my calendar with notifications so I can't forget.  
  
**The Turn:** So a day before the concert the calendar notification pops up and of course, I forgot and the notification saved me. I message my friends even: ""holy shit i forgot im seeing panda bear tomorrow lol"". So I go online the day of the concert, getting directions to Brooklyn Steel and just doing a general double check, when I unfold the ticket and look at it. The date of the concert is on there. May 5th... I had June 8th on my calendar. I had cleaned up already and everything. Told my grandfather I was going out to this concert already. But I missed it by a fucking month. I go back and tried to figure out how I fucked up the calendar, none of the other concerts I had looked at where on that day, why the fuck did I put it on that day? And for months I didn't look at the ticket, when I was typing it in my calendar somehow I didn't just look at the fucking ticket.  

**The Prestige:** I'm not going to tell my old man that the concert im supposed to be going to in 2 hours was actually a month ago, fuck that, I'm all set to go so fuck it. I'll get some cheap ticket for some random show and get drunk. Quick note, yes I was going to both concerts alone. Anyway, I measure out about 7~ shots into a plastic bottle, and had a shot before getting on the subway. Read along the way, take a some swigs. Finally get there, place is pretty empty, bands weren't bad, but not my cup of tea. Have two ipas, and things get hazy. Finish off the whiskey in the bathroom or something. Now i think were i fucked up was not taking into consideration the I hadn't eaten anything aside from breakfast, and those two impulsive beers at the bar. Next thing I realize is I'm in a hospital bed, and a doctor is pricking my finger. I Start sending wasted videos to some friends. Keep telling the doctor that I don't know why I'm in the hospital, that I just need to get home, I'd just been drinking etc. Eventually the doctor comes back and says everything looks fine and I say can I leave then? So he has me walk down the hall and back and I manage fine, so he walks me out the hospital. So at this point I have no idea what time it is, or how I ended up in the hospital. I start to recall vomiting, which breaks my like 4 year streak of avoiding throwing up (i hate that shit). I can't remember if I ended up getting a cab or something, maybe I got sick in the cab the driver called an ambulance? Then I started getting real nervous that I threw up and passed out or something at the actual bar/venue. Or maybe I did make it home and I fucked up and my grandpa caught me in my sorry state. Welp, too wasted at this point, luckily the hospital i ended up at was only 12 blocks from home, considering the show was downtown that was a huuge blessing. But after that nothing. I wake up the next morning super hungover, and a shit ton of physical anxiety. Laying in bed unsure of whether my old man knows how fucked up i was last night. I was in bed from about 10 to 5 trying to sleep the hangover off, couldn't sleep. Phone was dead, but somehow I didn't lose anything. Finally work myself up and charge my phone. Friends were worried because they just saw snaps of me in a hospital, and then the last snap was me saying im trying to find a cab past midnight, then nothing from me. Apparently I sent a snap of me pissing right on Broadway outside the hospital. Now I look like a fuckin alcoholic, because I've been in similar situations before (always alone) but this was the worst one yet (they're usually spread out). Check my credit card transactions, and lo and behold a fucking 60 dollar cab ride, so i guess i did get a cab and make it almost home before i must have gotten sick and someone got me an ambulance. I always stumble to the 1 train no matter what, but I fucked up and spent 60 on a cab. So 60+ to my credit card bill which was already over what i have in my bank account, cuz im retarded. But hey, turns out my old man is none the wiser, so I got that going for me, which is nice.  

**TLDR;;** Thought my calendar notification saved me from missing a concert I bought a ticket for months ago. Turns out I put a random wrong date in my calendar and the concert was a month ago, went to some random one instead, got black-out drunk, ended up in a hospital, pissed in front of it in the middle of broadway, a 60 dollar cab fare on my credit card, and generally looked like an alcoholic retard, maybe I did some stupid shit at the venue too can't remember and no friends to tell me what I did",47,6/10/2018 21:12,tifu,kidshitstuff,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8q3hzw/tifu_by_getting_hyped_up_for_a_concert_that_i/,/r/tifu/comments/8q3hzw/tifu_by_getting_hyped_up_for_a_concert_that_i/,8q3hzw,I mean it might not be just that you look like an alcoholic.... ,CA[deleted],54,46:38.7
TIFU by swimming dizzy and not telling my coaches,"So I swim for a good club. We are 2nd best in our county and we have some very serious coaching. They won't let you go to the bathroom more than twice per month, they don't take bullshit light hearted, and if you don't listen you will do 3X200 butterfly. So we we're doing a very hard main set earlier on in the practice which involved a lot of 200 IM's (50 fly, 50 back, 50 breast, 50 free). It was very tiring and made me a little dizzy. At the end of practice, we did 200 Im's from the block, the first one was good. The second one made me a little bit more tired, but nothing that bad. Then the third one happened. Where I go off the block, there was a diving board that was down. The JV team finished there practice and they don't put the diving board up unless there is a meet at the pool. So when I went to do my third (and final) 200 IM, the dizziness struck. I veered right and when I went off the block, my forearm got caught under the metal part of the diving board. I took a layer of skin off about millimeter deep and one inch wide. I finished the 200 IM but I was in a lot of pain, I had to get it disinfected and it started oozing blood. Now, it hurts like hell and will take a few months to completely heal and a few weeks to completely scar. So don't swim dizzy.

Edit: I also can't swim for the next week

TIFU by burning myself with heat and cold,"My mother worked night shifts so I cook for her every afternoon. When I dumped chopped vegetables to stir fry in the pan, the oil exploded. The vegetables were recently washed and was still wet and some boiling oil landed on my wrist. Soon blisters emerged on my wrist signaling second degree burn. 

I applied some ice pack on my wrist and it didn’t feel cold enough and my blisters still burns so I added some salt and the ice got a lot colder. I put the salted ice pack on my wrist and it felt a lot better and I hopped onto youtube to watch some videos. 

Soon 40ish minutes passed and I lost all sensation on my wrist (I feel nothing, not even the weight of the ice pack or the chilliness). I peeled the ice pack off and my skin has become completely white and it is frozen solid. I realized my fuck up and quickly rinsed my skin with room temperature water and my skin swelled up and now my entire wrist region feels like its on fire and I am sweating profusely. 

From online search, my skin will continue to hurt for several days. And fortunately, its only my left hand, so I can still do most things in life with my dominant hand.

TIFU by permanently burning myself trying to connect with my recently deceased dad.,"This was actually a week ago, but the story starts before that.

For the last five years, I've had an ice cream tub full of sugar in my kitchen. I emptied it into the tub rather than have the bag spill sugar whenever I used it. I don't use sugar a lot, so I've never had to refill it, I just dip into it when I need it.

My girlfriend thinks this is weird, and she thought it was weirder still when I packed the box to move with me when we decided to move in together.

""Don't bring your weird five year old sugar tub, for fuck's sake.""

""It's perfectly fine,"" said I. ""Sugar doesn't go off."" 

""It does,"" she said, wrongly.

""It doesn't and I'm not going to throw out totally useable sugar.""

So the sugar tub resides in our baking cupboard now, as a tiny point of pride. I want to see how long it takes for the sugar to run out. Maybe it will outlive me, at which point it will be inherited by my beautiful, supportive, wrong girlfriend.

---o---

Fast forward to this past January. My dad dies suddenly and unexpectedly. He falls off the roof while fixing a skylight, a day before someone was coming to start work on repairing the entire roof - including the skylight. But that was my dad to his core. He didn't know how to stop. He single-handedly ran his business - selling boating equipment and fixing outboard engines - for 47 years, a minimum of six days a week, until the day he died.

I am not that person. I love stopping. I'm self-employed too, but I put the bare minimum in to survive and spend the rest of the time doing whatever I like. My dad couldn't have lived like that. We were very different people, and that made his passing all the more difficult because now we'd never get any closer - the slightly awkward, stilted conversations I'd had with him in life were now all we had. That was as close as we'd gotten.

Fast forward again to last week, early June. We're trying to sell his shop, but it's a tip. Sadly, a couple of weeks before he died he invested around £50k in restocking the shop, and so the back shop is full to the ceiling with empty cardboard boxes. And the secondary room, his workshop, is full of tools, spare parts, half-empty paint cans and half-finished engines that haven't been touched in at least a decade, very likely double or triple that.

I get to work. Breaking down the cardboard boxes doesn't take as long as I thought, and after lunch I start on the workshop. My dad specialised in Seagull engines, which are now collectible, so I'm sorting everything into Rubbish piles and This Might Be Worth Something piles.

Then, at the back of a jammed drawer, under some oily rags and a grimy toothbrush, I find an ice cream tub. I open it up, and it's half-full of sugar.

The best before date is from 1998. So he's had this box of sugar since I was 12 years old. Maybe longer. For his coffee I'm assuming.

I call my mum through from the front of the shop.

""Look,"" I say. ""Dad had a box of sugar.""

""Why would he have a box of sugar?""

*""Because its perfectly bloody normal, that's why.""* I take a photo to send to my girlfriend, hoping my smugness will come across without needing to caption it.

""Won't it be out of date?""

""Guh, no.""

She doesn't look convinced. I lick my finger and dip it into the sugar.

""Look,"" I say, ""It's fine.""

I put it in my mouth, and know immediately that it's not sugar. It's bitter, and it's bubbling, and fuck everything my tongue is burning. I run out of the workshop and take a swig of coke, swill it around my mouth and spit it into the street. I do that another half dozen times, but I've already burned my tongue very badly. One of my dad's friends comes from the end of the pier.

""Everything okay?"" he asks.

""Yeah. Ugh. I just ate what I thought was sugar from an ice cream tub in the back. It wasn't sugar.""

He laughs. ""Why would your dad have had-""

""I DON'T KNOW.""

He walks in and comes back with the tub. It's caustic soda, he says. For cleaning engines.

I now have chemical burns on my tongue. It's been a week, and they haven't healed. I can't eat or drink anything in the least bit hot or acidic. I told my girlfriend, and she didn't even laugh. Apparently having an ice cream tub full of sugar isn't normal.

**Tl;dr: My girlfriend makes fun of me for having a big tub of old sugar. I find a big tub of old sugar in my late father's workshop, and in a haze of validation taste it. It's a chemical cleaning agent.**

For background, I am a soapmaker. Soap is basically just fats and lye (aka caustic soda) mixed together. When I was first starting out, I had a crappy plastic jar that I used to hold my lye water mixture. One day, I noticed that a ton of condensation had pooled up under the jar. Deciding that it was just a little odd that my lye water had started condensating (but not having the common sense to know that that's not how any of this works), I decided to taste test the little puddle that had formed, just to be sure that it wasn't lye. 

It was lye. 

Your tongue will take about two weeks to heal up. The blisters on your tongue will shrink up, and your taste buds will go back to almost normal eventually. The embarrassment takes just a little longer to fade away though. ",CA[deleted],1855,46:41.1
TIFU by dropping a plate of food on a child and blaming them.,"So me and some of my co-workers went to a buffet place to celebrate the promotions that many of us had received. At this one particular instance, around 5 of us went to grab some food. I made the mistake of picking up a new plate, so it was automatically hot from the get-go. Instead of putting it back, I continued and proceeded to put some hot food on my plate like the idiot I am. At this point I was really struggling to hold onto the plate due to my sensitive skin meaning the heat was hurting me. I was too focused on my plate and that I failed to notice a child who just ran in front of me. They were around half my height (I am 6ft8 and I assume the child was around 6-7 years old). Before I saw them, it was too late.

As soon as I bumped into them, I dropped my plate. It landed upside down on their head, their hair now a mess of curry, pasta, and chicken (I have a very weird diet). It took me around 2 seconds to realise what I had done and the kid started to cry. I knelt down and started talking to them as they held their plate of pizza and garlic bread in their hands. I started saying to them something along the words of ""Hey, i'm really sorry. Are you OK?"" before their mother arrived and proceeded to shout at me as we were quickly surrounded by cleaners, other customers, and the head chef, who pulled me to one side. I knew that the right thing to do would be to admit to it and walk away, but I was in the heat of the moment and didn't want to embarrass myself in front on my friends. I said to the chef that the child had walked into me and I tried moving out the way, but it was too late and we collided.

He said OK and told the story to the child's mother, who proceeded to explode in anger and demand that I be expelled from the restaurant (which I agreed with in my head). Everybody turned silent in fear - I was truly embarrassed beyond description. The head chef proceeded to defend me and said to the woman that her behaviour meant she was to be ejected from the restaurant immediately after her child was cleaned and she payed. A greater argument followed, but I, not wanting to get involved any further, went back to my table and simply had a drink. I didn't eat anything else (not that I wanted to anyway) because my co-workers had decided that, due to the scene, it was ""hurting our company's reputation and public image"" and was a risk to our promotions, so we payed and left. The woman was outside, trying to comfort her child, but then she spotted me leaving and came up to my face shouting at me. I couldn't remember what she said and I simply ignored her. My co-workers got into their cars (we all travelled in 5 cars to get to the restaurant quicker) and we left the premises quickly.

My good friend let me stay the night in his apartment as I recovered from my situation, as our other co-workers worked to hide their social media presence. It was too late, as our boss had already heard after not only being alerted by somebody in the restaurant who reported us, but also after we had made the front page in our local newspaper. Knowing it was all my fault that this monumental fuck-up had occurred, I told the boss the ""truth"" about what happened: the child ran into me. He was extremely mad, going on a speech about how his company's reputation was in danger and how shares could fall and we could all lose our jobs, before giving me a 3-month suspension without pay. As I was just about to leave the room, he told me ""accidents will happen. Just shake it off,"" which made me chuckle, as he knew I was taking my fiancee to a Taylor Swift concert the next night overseas. Everybody's else job got saved as a result, leading them to thank me for my ""honesty"". However, the mother of the child was later interviewed and revealed her intention to sue me, so I wasn't out yet.

**TL;DR: I dropped a plate of food on a child and blamed them, resulting in a 3-month suspension from my job and an impending lawsuit.**

TIFU by helping a woman with her cart,"I did a quick shopping trip today, and being super lazy I always park next to a corral so I don’t have to walk far after I load up. I finish up and go to put my cart away but there’s a woman standing there and her cart is in my way. She’s standing by the back door doing something with her small child, so I figure she has her hands full and I’ll help her out by putting both of them away. I grab her cart and start pulling it into mine and she immediately turns around and grabs it and tells me she had just taken it and that they weren’t leaving, they had just gotten there. Okay, my bad. I go to put my cart away again but hers is still in the way. I figure fuck it, there’s room, and try to squeeze mine into the corral past hers. Nope. Mine hits her and rams into her ass. She gives me a crazy look and pulls the cart toward her. At this point I’m so embarrassed I can’t even look in their general direction so I act like I’m looking at my doors-open unattended car on the other side of the corral and just quickly shove my cart in so I can make a run for it. Nope. Little girl put her fingers in the rail and I shoved the cart in sideways and smashed her little fingers.

TIFU by sending a threat message to a friend as a joke,"Welp, it wasn't today. It was 8 years ago when i was in 6th grade. My friends and I were telling each other scary stories and my best friend said her biggest fear was to receive a threat message so of course, being the little shit I was, I sent her a threat message. 



I had seen the ""send anonymously"" option on my message settings and it was the perfect  opportunity to try it which I always wanted to. So I wrote, ""Bring 50$ to school tomorrow. I'll be waiting at the school yard. Bring it or else.""


I was chuckling and giggling while imagining explaining her it was me who sent the message. I felt like a evil mastermind and it felt so good that i thought I'd wait a few more days before telling her about my evil prank. But I'm a moron so i actually forgot to tell her...



My friends and I were in restroom, talking about scary stuff again and my friend tells us about the super scary horrible threat message she got. The super scary horrible threat message that I sent. I felt the panic and horror spread to my body as I listened her story about how her dad and she went to the police and reported it and how the police is looking everywhere for the criminal. I started crying and yelling that it was me who sent the message and it was a joke etc. 


When I arrived home, I packed myself some water bottles and snacks, planning to lock myself in the bathroom. Mom asked me what was wrong with me, I hesitated to tell her, I knew dad would be furious and I didn't want to get lectured by her as well. In the end I told her and she laughed THEN I told her about the police, she wasn't laughing. I said I'd lock myself in the bathroom until dad calms down ( I didn't want to get beaten up) and I didn't know how long it'd take so I had packed me some snacks. Mom told me we'd take care of it without my dad knowing about it. Thankfully mom had a good friend whose husband was a policeman. My friend's dad didn't want to take the complaint down and I was thinking if I'd go to a jail and sobbing at the corner. Mom's friend's husband came to me and asked me what happened which made me sob hysterically. I proceeded to tell him every detail, I thought they'd shorten my sentence if I cooperated. He had a good laugh and said it was no big deal and I'd remember this memory when i get older and laugh about it. He reassured me that I would get away with it because my friend's dad took down the complaints but they have already opened a case and I had to sign some papers. 


Later, mom told me the police were alarmed because they couldn't track who sent the message at all and they thought they were dealing with a dangerous criminal mastermind. And that's how I got my first and only criminal record that will haunt me for the rest of my life. My friend stopped talking to me after the incident and I don't laugh at all when I remember the memory.

TIFU by sneaking out and getting locked out in rain,"Sorry for the bad format but I'm writing this on a phone.

 So me and my friends wanted to get baked and had no money, but I did have money at my house to get weed but it was late at night and my dad would be pissed if I just showed up late at night.

So we make a plan to goto my house late at night when my dad's at the bar. This makes a new problem: how to get out of the house. My friend grandma is watching him while his mom is somewhere else. It's late at night so we are waiting for her to go asleep to leave.

Finally it gets to about 1:20ish and my dad gets home from the bar around 2:15 - 2:30 and were about a 50min walk from my house. So we finally say we will go through my friend brothers window and just out it onto a roof and outside. We get out there at about 1:40 and now begins the hurry the fuck up part.(My friend that lives in the house stays behind)

So we start walking and crunching time and start trying to plan shit out so we don't get kidnapped and make it there on time and to make it less creepy we turn down a road I thought would bring us to the main road to my house. So we turn down this road and I realize I fucked up and we are wayyyy farther than I thought. So we start really crunching time and somehow get there at like 2:12 so I run in my dad's not home so I get the money and leave. 

Now were walking bad and my other friend isn't picking up his phone. So we make the walk back to his house and he's fuck sleeping or some shit. We try climbing back up the window BUT HE FUCKING LOCKED IT. all the doors are locked. So now that's brings us here. In his fucking garage in a tent that is for some reason here. 

I don't know what to do so I wrote this. It's 3:44 and I'll update and change spelling when I'm in a house and can re-read this. I'll update soon

Update: we finally woke him up and got inside 

TL;DR: Snuck out of friends house to get money. Friend that owns house stays behind while me and my other friend go and make the walk barely making it in time before dad gets home from bar and get back to the house find out everything is locked and it's raining.",12,6/10/2018 9:49,tifu,Stuckinatentoutside,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8pzm1p/tifu_by_sneaking_out_and_getting_locked_out_in/,/r/tifu/comments/8pzm1p/tifu_by_sneaking_out_and_getting_locked_out_in/,8pzm1p,[deleted],CA[deleted],3,46:46.3
TIFU by trying to help my gfs dad.,"Uh this literally happened half an hour ago and I feel like absolute ass. 
So after literally 10 fucking hours on the lake were all burnt chicken nuggets at this point. 

I gotta point out- he had shoulder replacement surgery maybe 7 weeks ago so when I’m here I try to help out as much as I can without making him feel like he can’t do it. 

So here we go: I’m the only one unloading all the shit and trash left in the boat trying to be helpful even though I’d been busting my ass all day despite not really enjoying it due to the heat. 
So he backs in, and doesn’t stop the back wheels of the trailer off with the concrete slabs like we usually do. 
I mention to him “should we block off the tires before I unhitch the trailer?” “Nah they’ll be fine” is his response. 
Okay I think in my head- I’ve unhitched the trailer probably 10 times. Not much too it so no big deal. 

All is going according to plan- put this piece of shit plastic wheel down that apparently is supporting a lot of weight and start cranking the handle. 

Pop- all is good trailer is unhitched and we’re all moving back inside. Keep in mind. He’s literally standing over my shoulder as I do this so surely if I did something wrong he’d say something. Right?

Nope. 

Next thing I know the entire trailer collapses and rolls forward slamming into the back of his brand new pick up truck. It definitely scratched it up but it didn’t dent the frame upon first glance. I’m like wtf just happened. He’s sorta low key being a jackass to me and I said “well you were watching me do it the whole time. I’ve done this shit 10 times and this has never happened so idk what to tell you”. 

This happened within the hour and I feel like shit and not sure how to handle the situation. We haven’t seen each other since. 


Woohoo awesome. Try to help someone out and end up fucking yourself raw. 

TLDR: caused my gfs dads boat trailer to collapse even though he was watching me as I did it and most likely ruined my future FIL’s impression / respect for me.

TIFU By Masturbating Too Hard Which Led To Having Surgery,"Obligatory this didn't happen today but when I was in the 8th Grade.

8th Grade was about the first time I discovered what masturbating was, give or take a few years. (Whatever year they show the ""Birds and the Bees"" movie at school) Well, needless to say, I was all for it. I think I did it just about everyday after school. And I was getting pretty good at it let me tell ya.

One day in particular though, I wanted to see how fast I could do the deed. So after school I ran off the bus and went straight to the bathroom and pulled out my....stopwatch. I counted down from three and went full speed. Let's just say I was a little too rough with my ding\-ding.

After I beat my record time, there was this strange tightness in my nether realm that was different from all the other times I had ""spatooshed"". I just assumed I over\-heated the poor thing and needed to let it rest so I laid down on my bed to take a nap. The tightness never went away so I had a hard time falling asleep. The tightness moved up and started to turn into a stomach ache, then a nauseous feeling, then a constant pain that felt like a burning cramp in my lower stomach area.

I was groaning in pain and trying to not to cry when my parents came in my room asking what was wrong. I told them that my stomach hurt really really bad. (I failed to mention that my Dangly Bits hurt a little bit too) So my Dad, being the classic Mexican dad that he is, just said ""Just drink this 7up and take some Tums and you'll be fine in no time."" Unsurprisingly, that did not fix my pain at all. 10 mins go by and my mom looks at me tossing and turning and says ""Thats it, I can't take it anymore. We're going to the hospital.""

Oh. My. Lanta. Talk about the worst 30 min car ride of my life. Every bump sent a new sharp pain through my body.  I thought I was going to pass out from the pain. This was my new worst pain of my life.

We eventually get to the hospital and get in to see a doctor. I tell him that there are sharp pains in my stomach that won't go away. I didn't tell them about my downstairs hurting too because, well, 8th Grade me was too embarrassed and didn't want people looking at my dingle\-dangle. So they run every stomach test in the book and wouldn't you know it, they don't find anything. At this point it's been 2\-3 hours since I got there so I say screw it and I finally muster up the courage to whisper to me mum ""Hey Mom, my uhh....balls hurt too kinda."" Right away she yells WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SOMETHING?! Then she calls a nurse to take a look.

The nurse lady comes in and says that it might be testicular torsion then proceeds to put on gloves, tells me to hold on tight, then MANHANDLES MY BEANBAGS! For those who don't know, testicular torsion is when one of your nuts literally turns around in your sack and is backwards. So this lady is trying to turn it back around with her hands! I SCREAM in pain. Now, I would never hit a woman in my life but I would be lying if told you I didn't raise my hand and was about to slap that bitch. Haha. Remember when I said the car ride was the worst pain of my life? Well this one was my new new worst pain of my life. Anyway, my right nut ended up winning the wrestling match so they prep me to surgically turn it back that way it was.

The surgery was quick and I didn't have a lot of pain afterwards. They went in there, twisted it back, and wired it in place so it doesn't turn again. I just had to wear a jock strap stuffed with gauze for about 3 days then I was back to ""normal"". Well, because Righty decided to take a left turn at Albuquerque, the veins that were connected to him got twisted. Thus stopping any blood flow that was trying to reach him. This means Righty shrunk. Like a lot. Lets just say Lefty towers over the little guy now. Could be worst though. The doctor said 30 more minutes and I would've lost him.

I ended up making the mistake of telling my friends about the shrinkage which resulted in some nice nicknames for my twins. Rob and Big, Dr. Evil and Mini Me, Pinky and the Brain are some of my favorites. Lol.

Lesson to be learned here: Some things are meant to be taken slow.

TL;DR  Wanted to masturbate really fast, twisted a nut, got surgery, now have 1.5 sperm balloons.

TIFU by fucking a wall,"Ah, Reddit. The home of coconut cummers, leather sofa fuckers, and some dude blowing some air into his urethra using a straw.

So you think you've read it all, huh?

So, TIFU, well technically not today, but it goes back several years ago. And yet, the mere thought of this particular fuck-up still haunts me to this very day...

Back when I was 10 or 11, I had just discovered masturbation. Being the uncircumcised, horny little piece of shit that I was, I masturbated just about everyday. I used my hands to stroke my pickle. I used to do it every time by the toilet, before I proceed to take showers. I used lube as well, and to avoid the embarassment of being heard by my parents while beating the hell out of my meat, I used to open the shower, to let the sound of it hide my pre-bath rituals. One day, I became very curious with how real sex does happen. I always visualized two naked people just spooning each other with an upward motion, so I decided to do it. I did not know why, but I did not use my hands, or lube at this particular day. I opened up the shower curtains, I removed all of my clothing, then I went up to the wall. I put my manhood in a parallel fashion, vertically against the wall. I began stroking my pickle up and down, in a somewhat thrusting motion, against a fucking wall. Now, during these times, I did not know about ejaculation and cumming, and all that shit. I just masturbated until I was satisfied. So, I stroked my meat against the wall for about 10 minutes or so, and then it happened. I felt all of the consequences of my action the hard and painful way. I felt a burning sensation underneath my dick, on a scale of one to ten, it basically felt like 11. Fuck. I immediately stopped after that, I did not continue my bath, and I just wet my hair a bit, and decided to put on my clothes.

Fuck me, I call on to my dad, telling him that my dick felt like it was being burned! The pain was immense. I had to take my pants of for my fucking dad! At the time, it seemed pretty weird. What if he knew that I was masturbating? What if he knew that I did it every time before I take a bath? All of these questions raced through my mind. He flipped my thing upwards and inspected it. It was reddish as fuck, and it had a fucking rash. It actually looked like a fucking fusion between a swollen strawberry and a fucking rotten tomato. He then proceeded to apply some ointment on it, probably to reduce the pain. I was not able to masturbate for about a month.  Fuck.

So kids, don't ever try to fuck a wall okay? Or you'll might as well end up with a fucking swollen, rotten, tomatoberry for a dick.

TL:DR, I fucked a wall, immediately felt the consequences of friction, had a dick rash, and I had to be naked in front of my dad so he could apply some ointment.",391,6/9/2018 5:51,tifu,fucc_awol,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8pqizc/tifu_by_fucking_a_wall/,/r/tifu/comments/8pqizc/tifu_by_fucking_a_wall/,8pqizc,Welp time for some r/eyebleach,CA[deleted],144,46:51.5
TIFU by tanning for so long my sunburn turned into a FEVER.,"Yes, this actually happened today.

So basically I woke up this morning deciding between getting a haircut and getting a tan. I decided to get a tan thinking I can get the haircut tomorrow. Fair enough, but I get bored easily, so I wanted to tan by riding my motorcycle as far as I possibly could until I can't go further anymore...without a shirt. Yup, half naked during the whoooooooole trip. I spent two hours straight going to a single, long\-ass road that is so long the road changes names and is really confusing the deeper you go. As soon as I landed on that road I kept going straight for simplicity's sake, getting as far away as possible from any clouds in the area and NOT SWITCHING ROADS. There were no tolls during the whole trip so that was a plus. It was 91 degrees outside, not a problem, I LOVE the heat and I despise the cold. The hotter it is, the better and I was riding in jeans without breaking a sweat! The breeze helped a lot, though. 

If I needed a drink, I would just go to the drive\-thru of any fast\-food restaurant and drink a large cup of water free of charge, so hydration wasn't a problem. Needed to take a piss? Any hidden corner is good enough. So I kept going, and going, and going, but only my back was getting sunlight because of the angle of the sun. I figured my chest would get the rest on my way back, which should be 2 hours, anyway. When I stopped at the MD drive\-thru to get a drink I looked at the rear\-view mirror and my WHOLE BACK was red but my entire chest was white. I LOVED it. If I keep doing this every day for a week, I will get a tan all\-year long in no time! It happened to my arms, why not my back? 

On my way...back, only my chest got some red in it, not the abdomen. Again, sun's angle. So anyway, I looked like a lobster and I went back home to get some sleep, which I couldn't because my back was torturing me but that's okay, I have to fight through the pain. Then I felt less energy, then I started feeling weak, dizzy and lethargic. Then I realized...my dumb ass got a fever.

But how is that even possible? That's not supposed to happen! Dammit. 

So I decided to get some Chinese and drink lots of water and take some ibuprofen and here I am writing this story. Oh well...

TL;DR I decided to get a tan by riding my motorcycle for 4 hours straight without a shirt leading to a fever I currently have been controlling with food, water and ibuprofen.

UPDATE: Okay, guys, I am feeling much better now. Fever's gone and my back doesn't hurt as much anymore.

TIFU by not pushing a dog kennel door inward.,"Hey y’all. Apologies for poor formatting (mobile) and TLDR at bottom. Obligatory this happened last night, and it also happened at my job. I work at an animal hospital as a Veterinary Technician intern and we needed to get a dog from boarding to draw blood for a heart worm/tick test. So I grab a slip lead leash and go on my merry way. Now our boarding/kennel area has the typical metal chain link doors and sides along with the U-hook latch to keep the door closed. 

Typically, you should always push the door open going towards the dog, as it makes them back up and gives you more room to get the animal secured with a leash rather than them bursting out. The dog I was getting is rowdy but nice enough, just excited. I go ahead and push the door inwards or try to, but his toy is in the way. I get him to sit down and think nothing of pulling the door outward because he is being civil, and I have a good amount of experience working with dogs having been in the field for over a year as well as having had dogs my entire life. 

I had the latch flipped up to open the door and when I was going to grab the dog, the leash fell from my hand. As I was bending to pick it up, the dog bumped into the door and I promptly stabbed my eye on the U-hook latch while bending down.  Cue me clutching my eye, tears raining down and me thinking about how STUPID to not just move the toy to push the door in. 

After my shift, I debated whether or not to go to the doctor. PSA: I obviously should have gone last night. But I just got back from an urgent care this morning to the conclusion I have scratched my eyeball and I also have been updated on my tetanus shot. Time for antibiotics and cringing at bright lights.

TLDR; Dog kennel latch vs my eye = a scratched eye, antibiotics, and a tetanus shot for me.

TIFU by tripping over my own shoelace,"As required this fuck up did not happen today, rather towards the end of 8th grade. 

I never was a very athletic kid. Granted, I wasn't the most out of shape in my class but I was close. Me and my parents decided that I should switch schools because my old school started getting insanely small and the teachers weren't very good at doing their job. I joined this medium sized school (about 650 students) and decided that joining the soccer team would help me meet new people. At the time I knew nothing about soccer so during those first few practices before the season started I was always the last kid picked whenever we had to choose teams. But as the season moved along I climbed my way up to be the 3rd to last kid to be picked (major improvement, I know).

The tournament at the end of the year was just about to start. It was the first half and my couch decided to put me in as a striker. The field was quite wet but it was turf so nothing was really muddy. My job as the striker was basically to stay as far up the field as I could while still being on side. I was doing pretty well. At this point I have been on the field for about 10 minutes, the ball was on the other half of the field so I was walking around at the exact opposite side, waiting for someone to boot it all the way across the field.

The fuck up begins when my team gains possession of the ball. Because of this the opposing team starts slowly moving back, so I follow them. I was jogging backwards when all of the sudden I tripped over my shoelace. I fall backwards and catch myself with my left hand. When I hit the ground I heard a cracking sound but I just assumed it was a stick until I looked down at my wrist. My wrist was all kinds of fucked up. There wasn't any bleeding but my wrist popped out of my arm. My forearm looked normal, my wrist was about half an inch above my arm, and my hand was back where it was supposed to be ( \_\_\_\-\-\-\-\-\_\_ \<\-\- accurate picture). Now I ain't no doctor but I immediately knew something was wrong. I held up my other hand and was jogging across the field yelling at my coach that I needed to be subbed out. My coach didn't notice until I was standing right in front of him. Luckily my school always has a trainer on the field in case someone pulls a muscle or something so they sit me down in his golf cart. He gives me a sling and some ice and asks me what my parents phone number is because I need to go to the hospital. I tell them ""I don't have it memorized, but my phone does"". I tell them my phone is in a black laptop bag. It took 7 different bags until they brought me the right one. It then took them 3 tries to find the right pocket. It then takes another 2 tries to unlock it correctly (I have a 4 digit pass code). After they finally figure out how to call them it turns out they were sitting in their car watching this all happen. They didn't come down to the field because ""they didn't want to be those parents that rush to their child as soon as they get hurt"". At this point the trainer decides to drive me over to the parking lot so he turns on the golf cart and drives *in the opposite direction of my parents.* I tell him hes driving the wrong way and he immediately makes a 180* degree turn on the field while the game is st*ill going on.

I finally get into the car and the first thing that happens is my parents argue about whether or not they should go home first or go to the hospital first. My mom wants to go to the hospital first because I am clearly in a great deal of pain and my dad wants to go home first so that he can grab his badge which gives him special access inside the hospital (he is an anesthesiologist at the hospital we plan to go to). My mom decides it will be quicker to just go home instead of arguing with him in the parking lot of my new school. Driving home was one of the most painful drives I've ever experienced. Every bump made my arm hurt. The drive to the hospital was even worst because there was a lot more traffic due to the fact that it was also rush hour. It has now been more than half an hour since I fell and we are just now arriving at the hospital. Of course the place to check in has a line. There is a family of 5 ahead of us and the lady checking everyone in is in absolutely no rush. She starts talking to them about how their weekend was etc. After we finally get checked in we have to wait for the nurse to come get me. Best part is that I'm the only person in the waiting room that is in physical pain. Everyone is looking at me while I'm struggling not the scream because of my arm. After about 5 minutes the nurse comes and gets me and measures my weight and height. We skip the height part because I can't stand up at all. She then takes me to my room where they will be snappin my arm back in place and putting a cast on. They give me pain killers and I start relaxing a bit more. While I'm under anesthesia I blurt out whatever comes to mind. The surgeons apparently found me funny so they decided to give me some free ice cream :)

I also just so happen to be lucky enough to have a bleeding disorder known as Von Willebrand. I don't have that normie Von Willebrands either. I have a special type that is a whole lot worse. This means that I have to stay over night in case there is internal bleeding which could result in me dying. This means that I had to be woken up every 2 or so hours so that the nurse could check to make sure I'm ok. Luckily nothing out of the ordinary happened and after a couple months I could take the cast off and go on with my life. 

Cut to 9th grade. I started to have pain in my wrist again. We go to the hospital and get an x\-ray. For those who don't know, your arm has 2 bones in it. These are called the radius and the ulna. My radius went under growth arrest because of the break but my Ulna kept growing. This resulted in my hand slowly being pushed to the right. I underwent an operation where they cut open my arm, stop the Ulna from growing, shorten the Ulna, and then put a plate with 7 screws and 2 pins that go through my entire arm. Luckily this operation worked perfectly. After a month they pulled the pins out (no painkillers. They just yank em out with a wrench. I passed out after seeing it but luckily nothing else happened). Finally after I got my cast taken off and after a couple of months of physical therapy, the only remains of the break was some big scars, one arm shorter then the other, a plate and some screws, and a good story.  

TL;DR I tripped over my shoelace while playing soccer which resulted in a broken wrist, 7 screws, 1 plate, 2 pins, 1 night 2 days in the hospital and half a year in a cast.

TIFU By not checking what kind of engine our lawn mower has before putting diesel in it.,"So, the act itself actually happened over a week ago, and we're just now realizing the extent of the fuck up. 

My husband and I recently moved into a beautiful home on 6 acres of land. A big upgrade from our last house and a lot more grass to tame, so naturally we bought a riding mower. We got a new John Deere, we figured we were able to afford a new one and we wanted it to last. 

Now, I grew up in ""the city"" (as much of a city you can get in our little state) so I've only ever touched a regular old push mower. And I've also only ever purchased an electric one, so the whole idea of putting fuel in yard appliances is still a little foreign to me. I completely trusted my husband to handle all of that because even though it's been a while for him, he grew up on more land than me and had experience with this stuff. More Experience=Totally Trustworthy. 

We never really checked what kind of engine our mower had. We ordered it online from a ""big box store"" and the other suggested purchases were diesel cans, and the owners manual when we got it had a big warning on the front about how in the state of CALIFORNIA, DIESEL ENGINE EXHAUST IS KNOWN TO CAUSE BIRTH DEFECTS yada yada. You know. Plus, my husband had a diesel tractor growing up, kinda similar to our lawn mower just a lot bigger. So obviously this takes diesel, right?

WRONG.

Anyway, last week I was just rolling along cuttin grass, enjoying the nice weather when suddenly the mower puttered to a stop. Whoops! Silly me. Ah well, I prepared myself for the embarrassing chuckles of the small-townees seeing me, a city girl, sitting on a stranded mower. Women, amirite? 

I have husband carry over the five gallon container of diesel, and glug glug, he pours it in. I'm feeling quite sheepish because it's really bad to run a diesel engine dry, and a bitch to get it running again, but he doesn't want me to feel bad and just uses it as a learning experience. 

Sure enough, we go to start it again and smoke starts pouring out of the hood. Not surprised because I ran it dry. We push the mower to shelter husband tries a bunch of stuff but still, mower won't run for more than 10 seconds and is still angrily blowing smoke. 

Cue a week+ of trying to call the (completely and utterly useless) local tractor store, who ""big box store"" used to deliver the mower to us and who we were instructed to call with any problems, and who we think absolutely hate us because we ordered the mower from ""big box store"" before we knew this local store even existed. This entire time the mower was just sitting in its poison, untouched until we had time to look at it again, which was today. Husband went out to tinker, and then came back in with the most pained look, I thought he might have ran over the dog! I asked him what was wrong.

""It takes unleaded gas."" 

So, here we are trying to figure out how to save ourselves from having a couple thousand dollars completely in the trash, and I'm also hoping I don't lose my husband to a fiery inferno while trying to figure it out.

TL;DR We assumed our lawn tractor took diesel, it doesn't. We could be out a lot of money and we might explode.",24,6/9/2018 16:34,tifu,ten_somany,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8ptkac/tifu_by_not_checking_what_kind_of_engine_our_lawn/,/r/tifu/comments/8ptkac/tifu_by_not_checking_what_kind_of_engine_our_lawn/,8ptkac,"Ummm...

TIFU By Ripping My Vaginal Opening 3 Times In A Week (NSFW),"There have been a series of uninspiring events that have led to intimate embarrassment. (P.S. before the end- sobering up and  on mobile- forgive me) 

It all started when my Vageesh was a fine, young thing (circa Monday night) when I finished a round of antibiotics for a sinus infection without probiotics because I thought I was indestructible and WHABAM! My little dough hole was infected with yeast. 

I scanned the aisles of Walmart at 11 pm and found Monistat. There were three types: one day, three days, or seven days. Apparently one day is the strongest version and who wants to wait seven days to clear up?! My boyfriend shot the little ovule up there and I felt relief from the itchiness. But, all good things come with a price: my vagina was swelling and burned. Oh well. 
Boyfriend and I got tipsy that night and had sex. There is a reason the box says don’t have sex for a few days. The cure, dried out my vagine!
I was a desert. Not a sweet creamy dessert. No. A desert. I just thought it was painful because it had been a day or two.  I bled a little, but it wasn’t that bad. 

It was that bad. The next morning my boyfriend and I are cuddling in bed and we were ready to rumble! I was the active pursuer, I wanted to heat things up. And, much to my chagrin, I didn’t have time for lube or foreplay. I got on top and settled down into pain. His happy extension felt like a prickly cactus expanding inside of me.
I couldn’t take the head out again. I had two options: tell him to stop and wait for him to get soft to get him out or make him orgasm. Ultimately, I chose the latter, because it seemed to be the speedier option. Sex, it turns out, is not sexy when the movement limitations are only a few centimeters. But we got ‘er done and I was pleased. 

I went to the pallid piss pot and there—drops of blood colored the toilet. I mustered the courage and took out my phone to view the damage. I saw the line right beneath my opening- I thought only child bearers dealt with this horror. 
I did a proper google research of vaginal tears and decided to wait the minimum suggestion of two days, which brings us to  tonight. 

Tonight my boyfriend and I attended a house party. It was amazing! The food was great and the games were fun, I was starting to feel like a real human again and not like a leaky, itchy, walking sorrow. We drank a little and walked back to our place. As he went to the bathroom I properly undressed myself and lathered some coconut oil onto my wounded warrior. It still burned, but my rationality was elapsed because I wanted to connect again. He came out and noticed me. Well, duh- unfortunately I do not have the one ring- but, I mean, I was standing there proud and willing. We took things to the bedroom. On top and rumbling-I felt the cactus cock crack my scab open again- winced and took things back to innocence. 

 But, I was determined to fulfill my sexual desires...I enjoy some anal play. I know the feeling of a nice dump is not the only pleasurable booty pop. I suggested it and he was intrigued so he stuck his finger in my bum to ease into things to which I said rather tipsily 30 seconds in “Remember, if you feel a doo-doo just hide it from me.” Yes, that was the word choice I used, and no, he did not hide it. He immediately pulled his finger out and I knew. He told me he never knew that was what he was feeling until I told him that. We had a good laugh, my vagina is bloody, the tear is a deep canyon when it once was a paper cut, and I’m constipated. My OB/GYN and no items for insertion await my broken vagina. 

TL;DR: Refused to take probiotics on antibiotics-got a yeast infection- used extra strength monistat- chemically pained my vagina, dried her out- super aroused all week- had sex three times: each time ripping the vaginal entry deeper and deeper- when the pain wouldn’t quit but I still wanted to have sex, I suggested anal as my cut bled- finger in bum say “Remember, if you feel a doo-doo just hide it from me.”- clear he felt it. Embarrassed, constipated, and bleeding.

TIFU by swallowing a fork and having my stomach cut open,"So, this didn’t happen today, and instead happened last year, November. 

Onto how this happened, at the time, I was bulimic, and had been doing it for quite some time. My fingers lost effectiveness as my gag reflex went up, eventually the toothbrush, so I needed something more hardy, I settled (for some reason) on a fork. I had used it many times without issue, except for.... this time. 

I suppose in gagging the fork was sucked down, and had gotten stuck in my throat. I tried pulling it back out, but a slim metal object covered with saliva isn’t exactly the easiest thing to get a grip on. It went down with the groove of my mouth, and with the smooth end, not the prongs. At one point I flipped the fork around against the groove of my mouth whilst trying to pull it out, and it was then cutting into the top of my mouth/gums. Naturally causing bleeding. I eventually flipped it back around to where it was with the groove. 

I then went to my mom (I was 17 at the time this happened, 18 now), to try and communicate the fact that I just swallowed a kitchen utensil, which wasn’t the easiest thing to do, seeing as I couldn’t speak and it wasn’t exactly the simplest thing to explain by making muffled noises of me saying “fork” and pointing to my throat. Eventually she got it, freaked out, called my dad, and he came over, called the ambulance etc. 

By the time the ambulance arrived the fork had moved down to where you couldn’t actually see it in my mouth anymore, so in trying to examine it they couldn’t see it. I was then put on a stretcher, and was taken to the closest hospital. 

The hospital they took me to, was a kids hospital, and, for some reason, they took a 6’1, 17 year old, to a kids hospital, and this has meaning later on. 

In walking in essentially the entire first floor staff had gathered around the door to watch the dumbass who swallowed a fork come through the door. Naturally, I gave a thumbs up and mumbled “Sup” as they rolled me through the door. Then came legal documents, etc. and prep for surgery. As well as my dad recalling that when the doctor came down to look at the X-Rays and all the paper, his only initial response was “Wow.” 

All that happened next was the wait for surgery. They rolled me off to a room until everything was ready. I waited, for 3 hours, from when I arrived (no pain meds because they didn’t wanna relax the muscles), only for them to come out and tell me they don’t have the tools that fit my size and would have to move me to a different hospital. So there’s where it being a kids hospital came into play. 

They sent me downtown to a bigger hospital, about a 45 minute ambulance ride, in which I actually fell asleep during because eventually they caved in and gave me Ativan. 

I arrived, and immediately went into surgery within about 10 minutes. The surgery was supposed to last 30 minutes, it took 6 hours rather. The issue was that they could pull the fork up the top of my esophagus, but couldn’t bring it through the curve leading up to my mouth. Eventually, they had to push it down to my stomach, cut that open, and then remove it that way. 

Surprisingly, I didn’t have any internal injuries, which they said was a miracle. No punctures, nothing. Only a cut stomach. 

The rest is basic recovery stuff, took 5 days for me to go home. 

Whew, long read, but to anyone who stuck through it I thank you! If any one wants to see the fork I can post pictures of it, we still have it as the doctor sanitized it and handed it off to my dad, a good ol $70 grand fork at the end of this. 

TL;DR swallowed a full sized metal fork, couldn’t pull it out, had it pushed down to stomach and had stomach cut open to remove it. Somehow, no punctures or injuries.

TIFU by storing my pepper spray in my bra,"This actually happened today. 

So I graduated from university this morning, and since my neither my gown nor my dress had any pockets, when I was leaving for the ceremony I brought the bare minimum, my phone and my keys. Now since I’m a woman living in a city, I keep a big old pepper spray on my keychain. By the time I thought to take it off, it was too late. Luckily, I thought, this is what bras are for, right?

So I put my phone in one cup and my whole keychain in the other. It’s not comfy, the keys are poking into my titty. After we all walk to our places on the stage, we have to stand in front of everyone for half an hour while speeches are made. Pretty soon I start squirming around because I have this deep sore pain in my left nipple. I’m standing behind a tall person so I go ahead and dig the keychain out of my titty. I’m not proud. I stuff it up my sleeve instead.

To my surprise, the pain doesn’t go away, not even after the ceremony, not even after I get home and change into my comfies. So I’m sitting here inspecting my boob, and I can’t see any redness or mark anywhere, but the pain is getting worse. A few minutes later I lick my finger and I feel this spicy burning sensation on my tongue. Shit.

Now I’m nursing both my tongue and my poor left nipple with a cold washcloth. I checked and sure enough, the safety was off. Any info on how long it takes the effects of pepper spray to wear off?

TIFU by peeing in a water bottle.,"TL:DR Tried to sneak a leak and got yard sale'd directly to the disability line. 

This happened practically first thing this morning.

 So I work ""in the field"". And by that I mean I drive around and repair stuff at peoples homes. I pick up the company vehicle and parts I need for the day from the warehouse, then spend the next 8ish hours driving around the county doing repairs and estimates.
 

 My first job today was rough. The issue was much more complicated (and expensive) than she wanted, and she was asking me every question imaginable, then telling me my answer is wrong. Then there was a part that I broke it MORE so I need to fix it all free of charge. (The part in question was not functioning because it had burnt and melted itself, and when I unbolted it to inspect for said damages inside, it crumbled apart...thus I broke it) After explaining and listening to this woman reject all of my reasoning, I Dismiss myself to the van to make a phone call to the shop for advice...also I had to pee. When I have to pee and I'm on site, I'll go out to my work van, and wiz in a water bottle and dump it at the end of the day.  
 
   
I trot out to the van and station myself in the back barn door to where it's mostly shut and get let it rip.   Mid stream, the lady opens the door while blurting out whatever question she was going to dispute me about next, and I come tumbling out. Not a little tumble, like when someone opens a door you have you ear gently pressed to, and you are startled. No, I had myself positioned on a peg on the door to A:Support me in some weird squat formation, and B: Keep it from swinging open from the wind. As I'm tumbling out of the van, I leg go of the bottle and myself to grab out for anything to prevent me from tumbling...one hand grasps a 40lb pump that proved to be the exact opposite of anything helpful and my other hand grabs at the tray of misc. parts which prove just as effective as the pump as a support. 

 
So lets take a minute (the pain meds are making me feel like a writer) to catalog what this woman is watching happen.  Upon opening the door, like a cascade of balloons coming out of Beth's office as a ""happy promotion"" prank or whatever, a 6'1"" man is tumbling out of the van with a stream of urine, a bottle that got squished by something and sprayed the ground and inside of my van (thankfully not her), followed by a large pump and confetti of bolts, connectors, and switches.


 Now what she didn't catch in the middle of the water show and parts display, was the back of the latch for the other half of the barn door tearing a gash 23mm long under my left arm, and the pump falling and not only cutting my exposed organ, but fracturing my femur and bruising my pubic bone (It hit right at the joint).
   
 
I don't think there will be any public indecency charges thankfully. But I'm sure she'll spin this into free work and then try and smear our company over it too.  I'll talk to work when my nose isn't itching anymore, but I'm sure they'll laugh more than they'll punish.

TIFU by shooting myself,"Obligatory this didnt happen today, but a couple of years ago.

Note: Due to NDA, some details will be altered very slightly.

So a couple years ago Im at a buddies house having a typical guys night watching Top Gear. I tell them that after, the misses and I are going to go shooting for the first time at an indoor range that just opened up near us. Another friend will be joining us.

Up until now I have never shot at any indoor range, only outdoor ranges or just shooting areas. So being a noob at it, Im pretty excited about it. Friends inquire about the typical details and I indulge. The key detail here being ""What will you be shooting?"".

Well, my SKS of course! I just put some work into it and want to go enjoy it. Then my friends begin to laugh at me and make the typical Polish Jokes...you can guess the berating. 

I shrug it off as typical guy BS that all good friends do. I kindly inform them that the range explicitly allows these caliber guns and even larger calibers. SKS is the same round as an AK47, or 7.62x39. We were allowed to bring in and shoot up to 7.62x54.

The misses and I get to the range first, snag two lanes and begin having fun. I thought it would be a good time to try and dial in my red dot. I use a bore sight (laser sight that is in the shape of a bullet, makes it easier to get a scope/red dot closer and on target) originally to try and dial it in prior. Now I just wanted to see how accurate I got it.

I get my cool little scope attached and load up a nice 30-round mag. I send a few shots down range. But my eye sight sucks (near sighted) and I cant see if the target has holes though safety glasses. So I move the target in and out a few times to check. So Im not sure the problem was. But Im quite sure it was lack of ability and a possibly misaligned red dot.

I do my best to line up my next shot and squeeze. I immediately feel a hot stinging sensation in my right arm. I quickly look at my rifle thinking it malfunctioned or broke or something. I look at my arm, then at the rifle, then back my arm. I do this a few times as Im a bit confused. I expected the side of it be cracked or broken.

Meanwhile as I look on confused, my wife comes up and says loudly (ear protection) ""YOU'RE BLEEDING!""

""HUH?????""

Look down and my fore arm is pouring a thin, solid stream of blood out it. Leaving large drops of blood everywhere. I immediately leave the range and inform them I need some help please because of reason, such as the fact Im in shock and lots of blood.

I later find out I (may?) have hit a piece of metal in the range and it ricocheted directly back into my own arm. Later on, after surgery, a small piece of the metal jacket was removed my fore arm that was starting to sever the Ulnar Nerve (funny bone nerve that runs the length of your arm from elbow to between pinkie and ring finger).

Now, years later my dominant right hand and arm is weaker than my non dominant side. Im super happy it didnt cause more damage, but still sucks I cant use my arm and hand the way you would expect to.


TL;DR: Shot large caliber rifle at indoor range. Bullet (jacket) ricochets and sends shrapnel into right forearm.

TIFU waking up with a blood waterfall coming out of my nose and having to get surgery again.,"Happened this morning. For context, I got a septoplasty, which is done when you have a deviated septum (in ya nose) about 15 days ago. First rule of the book is clearly, don't fuck with your nose so that it recovers correctly. The inpatient baboon that I am I would remove the crusts on my own, party and play sports, pretty much the three forbidden things. Everything was going fine, i could breathe better than I ever experienced.

* Then I decided to go deeper. I felt a little pain and decided i should probably stop fucking around up there. Which I did. So i go to sleep with a slight headache. I'm dreaming about all lovely things when suddenly i wake up chocking on my blood, tilt my head up and start profusely gushing out blood at a speed and quantity i had never ever seen in my life. So it's all over my bed, I run to the bathroom leaving a massive trail of the red stuff and a pool of blood next to the toilet, looked like a murder scene (plus I was at a hotel and i didn't really warn the cleaning staff, so they probably passed out).

I go straight to the ER where they ask me if I fucked with my nose when i nonchalantly reply that I might've poked my finger up there once or twice. So the dude tells me that I have to get surgery again. Spent the whole day in the hospital, they fixed the broken vessel and now I have to wait another three more weeks before being able to do any sort of physical activity. Listen to your doctor, even if you think you've fully recovered, cause you haven't.

TIFU by telling a nasty joke to my class,"This happened around 8-9 years ago. Each class back then was defined as first hour(first class), second hour(second class), etc.

I was in eighth grade, and the school has a tradition of sending the eighth grade class to six flags for the students' accomplishments. Anyway, my English teacher assigned my class a presentation to tell a joke to our class a couple weeks prior to the six flags trip. I was reminded during my first hour class from my friend about our presentations for later that day. I totally forgot about it. I didn't want to say my overused jokes because my classmates had higher expectations of me (at the time, I shared class clown status with my friend), so I used my first hour teacher's computer to find new jokes. I ended up finding one and went off with my day.

I was finally up to present my joke. I asked my class ""why was hellen keller's pants so tight? So you can read her lips"". My entire class was silent. After like 6 seconds of silence, my friend bursts out laughing saying omg and stuff. My teacher walked up to me, grabbed my hand, and took me to the office. I was suspended and unable to go to six flags. Irrc, they didn't refund me either.

I truthfully had a different idea of the meaning for the joke. You know how if you choke on food or if you're stunned/shocked(maybe?), you can be left speechless sometimes? I sincerely thought her pants were too tight that she was too focused doing the shimmy dance thing that people do + was shocked. I never really talked to girls or understand much even though I took sex ed, but I messed around in that class so I didn't grasp any information. So I didn't know much about sex or terms involved since I didn't care for it.

TIFU by sending an email that to the whole school,"Well folks, we've got one interesting story here that is pretty much the whole message the entire school trope you used to see. 

For some context, this took place shortly after the student walk-out this year so there was already some political tension where I live, especially since my principal encouraged the walk-out. 

So shortly after this walk-out I find a picture of the girl who lead this walkout with a gun on her Instagram, which I clearly find hilarious being the dumbass teen I am. And I decided that the best way to do this was by sending this to the entire school because the school provided everyone with a school email that is linked to a bit that allows emails to be sent to entire grades. 

So I send this email along with a notice stating that my emails are meant purely for satire, and people who knew it was me find it hilarious but almost all of them were chill and didn't feel the need to be narcs. Notice how I said almost though, because one person, who we will call MB (Massive Bitch) decided to go straight to the vice principal. And he also decided to call me out in front of the entire school in the process via that same email. 

Then I notice the email MB sent out and my heart seems to stop. I use Snapchat to MB why he decided to call me out like that as well as confront him in the hall because of it. It course MB being the bitch he is decided to retell this non-violent confrontation into me beating him up just to make the damage worse for me. I'm eventually called to the office towards the end of the day and i head down where I'm met with the vice principal (VP) and the principal (MC)  

And the entire encounter with these two feels like Ornstein and Smough on crack because I decided to stop VP first leaving MC to try to use ""reason"" but enough of my rant because the whole encounter ended MC accusing me of threatening the student who was in the email and assaulting MB even though nothing happened and they delivered a 10 day suspension and quickly handed me the paperwork for my suspension, which expressed my right to an informal hearing, and hurried out the door before letting me react. Then i ended up being able to reduce the 10 days to 5 by some miracle as well as keep it off my record but still I was left out of school for five whole days.

TIFU by shooting a large gun 2/3 my size without eye protection,"This wasn’t today but when I was in middle school  maybe my 3rd or 4th time shooting with my dad. Back then I normally shot a .22 caliber, because I am not a big person, especially not in middle school. My dad asks me if I want to shoot a bigger gun. Of course I say yes because big guns are awesome. My dad lays this big sks down on the blanket we had on the ground in the open shooting area ( gun was similar as the one in the picture minus the bayonet)[Old SKS](https://www.reddit.com/user/DjSquidlehYT/comments/8ppfs1/old_sk/?st=JI6QBOOO&sh=c0a3d8c0) 
This gun was too big for my scrawny middle school body to try and shoot while standing so I sit down and I can barely reach the trigger while the stock was against my shoulder.  As I’m sitting down I’m having a difficult time trying to line up my shot because the gun was pretty heavy for me.

As I try and shoot I miss(because of course I did) and I hit the dirt hill behind the targets.

TIFU by ruining 20 cakes meant for the chronically and terminally ill,"This actually happened this morning and I'm still reeling with shame and embarrassment of it. Hopefully this will provide me with a little bit of release.


So a little bit of back-story, my mom is a really talented baker and for years baked in high end restaurants, but decided in the last couple of years to put her talents to more self-less causes instead. Now she works at a non-profit that makes food packages for people with chronic illness, people with cancer, aids, and various other kinds of awful diseases. She makes specifically the desserts, which are carefully planned in advance to have safe levels of sugar/carbs/etc. I just came home from college for the summer, and while I was there I decided to go and see her and volunteer a little in her kitchen, which is where the fuck-up begins.

She had made 20 sheet-trays of cakes, which were supposed to go to clients tomorrow.  When I came in she introduced me to all her co-workers, said how proud of me she was, typical mom stuff. Then she had me ice all of the cakes with like 40 pounds of icing in total. Finally, my job was to cut them all up into a specific size so each person would get a good amount. While I was cutting I carefully put lots of pressure, so the cake would full separate and we wouldn't have to tear them to get them apart. All goes seemingly well and I leave a few hours later with a sense of accomplishment and pride in helping out. Until tonight. 

My mom gets a call from her boss who's FURIOUS, and he says ALL of the cakes have tiny aluminum shavings from someone cutting them to hard. Literally 20 cakes are ruined, and the sheet trays are scratched to shit, because I put too much effort into cutting. Flashbacks of me asking my distracted mother if it was OK to cut through the sheet-paper on the bottom of the pan, making jokes that my arm was getting tired from cutting so hard, proudly parading the finished cakes through the bakery to the freezer, saying ""I helped make these"" to everyone I saw. This is like 10 hours worth of work for my mom, everyone in her work now knows me as the kid who ruined all these cakes, and now they have to scramble to make something to send out instead. I literally could have killed hundreds of ill people if they hadn't caught the slivers of metal when packaging them. Literally feel like dying right now.

TLDR: Ruined 20 cakes meant for sick people, wasted ten hours of my mothers life and ruined my reputation forever by cutting too hard ",1123,6/8/2018 2:36,tifu,FakeBake666,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8pfx57/tifu_by_ruining_20_cakes_meant_for_the/,/r/tifu/comments/8pfx57/tifu_by_ruining_20_cakes_meant_for_the/,8pfx57,"It was an accident, you can't see the bottom of the cakes, or see what's happening under there and it's not like you sabotaged them on purpose.

TIFU by wrestling with a bottle of fountain pen ink,"This one actually happened today, just so you know.


So I own a nice pen that writes pretty well, and I reload the ink using an ink converter with a piston and a bottle. Today I ran out of ink, so I grabbed a tissue, unscrewed the section of the pen and dipped it in a bottle of blue Parker quink ink.


This is where the fuck up happens.


For you see, the converter I used was a very cheap Parker one, and I didn't really like it because it's very stiff and difficult to move. I pushed the empty converter's piston out fine. When I tried to pull it back in to draw out some ink though, it was being stiff and annoying. So I pulled pretty hard. Hard enough to yank it off the bloody section.


The damn section, along with the nib, fell into the bottle.


I tried all sorts of things to try to get it out. At first I tried to use the converter to try to fish it out, then I upgraded to a pencil, before I finally got so desperate I used my own fingers, and if you've ever gotten fountain pen ink on your hands before, especially blue ink, you know how hard it is to wash that stuff out. It resulted in two tissues being lost for the cause, my own battle wounds, half an hour of time wasted, a pencil and my trousers being stained blue and severe trauma. In the end, I managed to get some ink into the pen and mostly cleaned up, so I suppose I won, but the losses suffered made the victory too bitter to enjoy.


TL;DR: Dropped a fountain pen nib in a bottle of ink, my hands are now that of a smurf's.

TIFU Telling The Dean The Truth,"This happened on a cold snowy winter night in 1970 when I was a sophomore at one of the campuses of our state university system. At the time my life was about studying pretty hard and looking forward to moving to the main campus for the winter or summer trimester. I was also taking a bunch of drugs, mainly marijuana and LSD. 
And, I had drug dealing friends who would visit from time to time. 
On this particular night we were visited by my friend ""Joe"" who lived in the middle of the state. He was a friend of a friend whom I'd gotten to know. He and a pal showed up with hundreds of hits of LSD to sell along with whatever other assorted stuff they might have had, hash if I remember correctly. I let ""Joe"" sleep in my dorm room for the night and we set about ingesting the LSD and sharing it with neighbors, which was pretty standard practice in those days. Some time around midnight as we were sitting in a dorm room, listening to the music, and ""Joe"" said he wanted to talk to me in the hall. We went down and sat in the stairwell and he started telling me about a problem he was having in his life.

As I listened I realized he was really out of it. He was mostly talking nonsense. At some point in the conversation though his tone and demeanor changed and he suddenly started asking me why I was against him and why I was undermining him. He was raving a bit and acting paranoid and I had no idea what he was talking about. He kept escalating this discussion and pretty soon he was speaking so loudly that my friends next door were yelling through the wall ""What's going on?"" The next thing I knew Joe picked me up and literally hurled me at a brick wall in the stairwell. We were about the ~~same height time~~ same weight at the time but he was muscular and about sixty pounds heavier than I was. Up until that point I was still trying to talk him down and avoid some kind of drug incident that would turn out badly for me and every kid in the dorm. Friends heard the commotion and rushed into the stairwell. They tried to talk with ""Joe"" for a few minutes but at some point he rushed at all of them, threw a few blows and then went out the exit door into the night. He was barefoot and clad only in shorts and a pajama top in freezing conditions. A couple of people ran after him but he vanished quickly in the snow.

This led to real panic among my fellow druggies in the dorm and we sent out search parties. Less than an hour later they encountered police who had been called to the campus. ""Joe,"" completely berserk by this point, had broken into a couple of on-campus houses. One of them belonged to the college President and apparently “Joe” had chased people around the house, waving a spatula and screaming out of his mind.

Back at the dorm some alert kids began going door to door taking every bit of drugs and paraphernalia in the dorm and shoving it into garbage bags. Then they carried it all deep into the woods to a riverbank where they dumped or buried it in the night. By dawn the dorm was clean.

The next day or the day after I was identified as one of ""Joe's"" acquaintances. Along with seven or eight other acidheads I was taken to the Dean's office where we were questioned together and separately by state patrolmen and educators. The police were incredibly lenient and the university really tried to cover up the problem with a minimum of publicity. But here's where I fucked up. We were standing in a lineup with the dean and a state patrolmen and the cop asked who among us had ever done drugs (really naive question, I know, but times were different). I went first and I said I had tried them all but wasn't an addict or any kind of a problem. Then, amazingly, all my druggie friends one at a time stood up and basically said ""well, we've heard of marijuana but we've never actually smoked any."" I could have fallen over in amazement. But the Dean actually seemed to buy some of it.

The next day the Dean called me in and told me I was being suspended for the remainder of the year. All my friends stayed in college. I was to go home and live like a parolee. I also had to go to counseling weekly. At the end of the year a university tribunal would decide if I could ever be allowed back in to school.
Looking back on it now, he probably did me a favor. I don't think I benefitted much from drug counseling but I did get a hunger to finish my education quickly when I finally got back into school. I was a much better student after my break. They let me back in in 1971 and I finished my degree a semester early. The drugs in a way are irrelevant; the story is really about risk and a total disregard for consequences and the safety of others; and misjudging situations and friends.

TIFU By biking alone and face planting on concrete,"So this actually happened Saturday night/Sunday morning.I was out having some drinks with my friends and although I was a bit tipsy, I wasn't necessarily drunk. However, I am quite stubborn, even more so when I had a bit to drink. So, I decided it was a good idea to bike home alone by myself. This is where the fuck up begins, considering it wouldn't be my first time getting scrapes from biking home when alcohol was involved. However, all of those were very minor and none of those come close to this fuck up.

The next thing I know I'm laying in my own puddle of blood and a stranger is comforting me and reassuring me that help is on the way. Apparently I've been laying there for about 30 minutes and lost quite some blood. It's all pretty hazy and i can't remember anything about what happened (I can't remember much about anything of the night previous to my fall. Doctor says it's due to the hit to my head). I somehow managed to fall of my bike on a straight road without any curves, face plant on the concrete and knock myself out.

I got a concussion, 12 stitches in my lip, they had to glue my chin, a fracture in my front tooth at the root, a fracture in the enamel of the other front tooth which has also moved backwards and two other teeth have a chip broken off.

I haven't been able to eat much besides liquids and i'm on a pretty high dose of morphine to deal with the pain.

I'm now never allowed to bike home by myself again.

Marked NSFW for the gory picture. [I look like a mixture of a zombie and the exorcist](https://imgur.com/a/BjVBwcs).

It took me 3 baths to wash all the blood out of my hair.

TL;DR Decided to bike home alone after a night drinking, face planted on concrete and messed up my face/mouth pretty badly. Never allowed to bike by myself again.

Edit: just a regular bicycle, no motorcycle!

Edit2: I'm Dutch. It's extremely common for the Dutch to bike everywhere, including home after drinks.

TIFU by tripping over a gas station hose,"This happened last night, and is still ongoing, so a very fresh TIFU for you.

I stopped by the gas station to fill up after grocery shopping last night, and I was going around to pick up the trash out of my car while I was filling up. I came around the back to get trash out of the backseat and realize the gas pump hose is in the way. Instead of going back around the front to get into the backseat, I decide that I can be careful enough to step over it. I got one foot over fine, but then the other foot got caught on the hose and I fell. Tried to catch my balance, failed, heard and felt a POP in my foot as I went down. 

Immediate pain. I look at my foot and it looks like [this](https://i.imgur.com/Fi2n1RQ.jpg). I start panicking and crying and two wonderful, kind ladies run over to me and start asking how they can help, if they can call someone for me, what can they do? They helped me get into the passenger seat of my car and waitied for like 30+ mins with me while I called my mom and she came to get me. They helped get my car out from the gas station and to my house and helped me get into my mom's car.

Mom brings me to the ER and I'm still crying, it hurts and I've never actually had to be in the ER for me for this kind of thing. I get seen by the Dr about two hours after check in. I get some x-rays that the nurse says are ""interesting"", he's never seen this in all the years he's been there. I don't like the sound of that but I kinda feel like it's an accomplishment. The ER Dr comes in about 30 mins ish after the x-rays and he's like, ""I've never seen this, this is very rare, I've only heard of this injury from football players"".  He hadn't even actually seen it, just heard of the injury. What happened is apparently I dislocated the midfoot bones and tore some ligaments. They called it a lisfranc  injury. The ER doc tries to call the orthopedic surgeon a few times, who isn't answering.

 I get some pain meds at this point, thankfully, about 3 hours after check in. I wait for a while until they get a hold of the orthopedic surgeon and it turns out he was in the OR, but he starts texting the Dr in my room and he gets some pictures sent of my foot and the x-rays. Surgeon is very concerned apparently. At this point, I've got Norco so I can finally focus on something other than the pain in my foot and leg, so as far as I'm concerned the man can take his time. I get rolled from the ER triage room to an actual room. They're saying they're gonna knock me out so they can try and manipulate the bones back into place so that it's stable-ish, but I will need surgery to fuse some bones together because the ligaments will never be able to keep the bones in place properly again. So I'm like, yep knock my ass out I'm NOT staying awake while you do that, I've got Norco and it still hurts, it's just my brain doesn't have to focus on it.

The surgeon is kinda excited as he is looking at my x-rays.

[x-ray 2](https://i.imgur.com/DknwLep.jpg)

[x-ray 3](https://i.imgur.com/lEuYymO.jpg)


Orthopedic surgeon says that this kind of injury is rare, and I happened to have a rare variant of it so they were gonna bring in some students to look at the x-rays and watch what he does.  Everyone was amazed when I told them how I did it; it's such a small action and it turned into this. 

They give me some ~~propynol (I think that's what it's called)~~ *[correction, propofol]* to knock me out and did their thing, mom said that they put my big toe in some Chinese finger trap looking thing and hung my foot by it while they were manipulating it. I don't know the name of it. But I guess with the meds they used to knock me out it makes it so I don't remember anything and my brain doesn't register the pain right, but they knew it hurt because I kept flailing. The flailing actually helped though, I happened to kick at the right time to let the Dr get the bone back into place so it isn't pushing against the side of my foot skin anymore, and they put a half-cast on it. 

When I came out of it, they gave me some ~~torpodol (name?)~~ *[Correction, toradol]* which did absolutely nothing, so they gave me some iv fentanyl which hit like a truck but was AMAZING. it was the first time all night that it didn't actually hurt, not just that my brain could ignore it. About an hour after waking up, I was discharged. I get to have surgery in a week or so to fuse some bones and I'm probably going to limp for the rest of my life.

TL;DR tripped over the gas pump hose and dislocated bones in my foot spectacularly. Ran into some angels at the gas station, gonna need surgery to fuse bones, and probably going to limp forever.

TIFU by trying to catch a rocking chair with my face,"Obligatory not today, but actually 13 years ago. I was helping my parents move out of my childhood home, and the memories reminded me of this 

Be me, 6 years old. I was the only boy with a twin sister and older sister 18 months older. My parents friends came over and brought their two daughters, also our age, with them. Top that with grandma in town, I was the only boy in the house until my dad came home from work. I’m not sure why, But i had this manhood complex, yes at 6 years old. I was the youngest, and to compensate I would always do the most manly things. Often I was egged on with my sisters teasing me telling me I couldn’t, I wasn’t strong enough and the like. 

I had had enough, and was overly confident this day. After trying to get someone to play hot wheels with me to no avail, I was driving my rc dr. Seuss car around at the bottom of the stairs alone, mildly angry but also enjoying it. From the top of the stairs I hear my sisters laughing and arguing. I yell at them and ask what’s up and they start laughing. I kept asking why they were laughing until finally the stopped and said they were laughing because they didn’t think I could pick up the rocking chair the were all show boatingly picking up and carrying at the top of the stairs. 

This pushed me past the boiling point , and I had enough. So I fought back saying of course I could carry it, and I bet I could throw it and catch it too. Mind you, this was a rocking chair built for a 6 year old so it’s not large but it is also solid wood. Whatever

So after constant yelling and teasing and laughing the girls at the top of the stairs yell oh yeah and push the chair down the stairs 

Now at this point, I’m in power position. Ready to catch. But almost immediately I realized the carpet stairs weren’t slowing the chair down at all, contrary to what I thought would happen. Suddenly I was freaking out so instead of trying to catch it i was bracing for impact. And at the exact moment the chair was gonna make impact, my dad opens the front door and I stop to look and boom 

The sharp point of the arc of this rocking chair struck me about 5 millimeters above my pupil, getting soft skin in between my eyebrows and eyeball. I immediately felt the burning blood in my eye, and I couldn’t open it. And the eye socket swelled almost closed over my eye. I still remember everything vividly, being rushed to the sink, all the parents screaming yelling st the girls or trying to help me. 

Worst part was I went to urgent care with my dad, but they didn’t believe him when he said a rocking chair struck me in the face. So they immediately separated me  from my dad, which made me cry even more. So while I was alone, with ice packs on my face with one side swollen crying my eyes out, strange doctors were asking me what had “actually happened” and if my dad hit me. Was an absolute mess

But , I got lucky. And the chair missed my actual eye ball. Just have a weird lookin scar above my eyeball now, and no my dad did not go to jail lol

TIFU by eating sunflower seeds.,"     
So the story began last night, I was playing some civ 5 and was chowing down on some sunflower seeds. I had been trying to learn how to de-seed them because I only ever knew how to eat them whole. The only thing I had learned from that little endeavor was that I knew how to bite my tongue. Anyways, I ended up getting frustrated and began eating the seeds shell and all. I would bite my tongue a million more times if it was to stop what would happen later on.

If you guys know civ 5, you know games an last hours. During this time, I went through a bag and a half of sunflower seeds.

Everything was fine until the next morning hit. I felt the biggest shit of my life coming, so I ran to the toilet and tried starting my business. On my first push, I felt what could only be described as thorns tearing my ass. These ""thorns"" were gripping my asshole and would not come out without a fight. I had to sit on the toilet for the next hour pushing as hard as I could to finally rip these bastards from there home. During which, when I wiped, the toilet paper was covered in more blood than shit. I sat there with my eyes tearing up from one of the worst pains of my life. When I was finally finished, I got to see that these ""thorns"" were actually just the shredded sunflower seed shells that I had devoured the night before. 10/10, would not do again.

I am typing this from my bed, recovering from the shredded and sore asshole that I received this morning.

TL;DR I ate a bag and a half of sunflower seeds with their shells and shat blood when those shells found their way out the other end.

TIFU by diving into concrete,"Me[F22] and.... A little over a year ago I was hanging out with a couple of guys (one who is my boyfriend now) doing college stuff you know the usual casual drinking during the summer, smoke here and there... We are with a small group of friends and as we go deeper into the night everyone leaves and his roommates are passed out. 
Him and I are still wide awake yet a little drunk and he suggests to go out around 01:00 am, he takes his bicycle and I take my long-board (I have only been boarding for about 3 months at that time). So we are outside having fun really feeling the atmosphere, I am boarding somewhat ahead of him trying to show off my really cool long-board and notice piles of pinecone ahead.... Instead of stopping and walking  over the pinecones I immediately speed up on my long-board so I can go over it but lol the pinecones abruptly stop my long-board sending me flying into the concrete and bursting my lip. 
Drunk me gets up straight away and laughs it off with a mouth full of blood in front of this guy I am crushing on and I tell him it is absolutely fine that I am okay and I feel the stinging so I ran into water sprinklers to calm the stinging and end up having my clothes soaking wet with blood from my lips.

TIFU by ODing my dog,"For disclosure, this didn't happen today but rather yesterday.

I've been rather sick for a few weeks now with a kidney infection that's pretty resistant to antibiotics so I've just been moping around the house and getting high since there's not much else I can do besides be miserable. A few nights ago I was tempted to have a pot brownie so I heated it up in the microwave and sat down on the couch with it. I eventually changed my mind and decided not to eat it because I felt sick and went to bed thinking I'd just chuck it in the bin in the morning. 

Evening came (my sleeping pattern is backwards) and when I wake up I stay in bed after taking her outside to the toilet, because well I'm sick and lazy. My dog which sleeps next to me and is basically inseperable to me gets up a few times and I hear her walk out to the kitchen, so I presume she's just having some food and water. She soon returns to bed with me. She falls asleep right next to me and twitches a bit in her sleep, as dogs do when they dream. I eventually get up to go to the toilet and come back, and as I sit down I realise that she's peed in my bed. Oh no, I thought, something is seriously wrong. She was extremely lethargic and was wobbling all over the bed. 

I'm a panicker and she has a history of unexplained seizures months apart so I immediate call the closest emergency vet and tell them I'll be on my way. I arrive 30 minutes later and she can barely stand. Her tongue is out of her mouth and she's absolutely out of it. During the emergency consultation ($210 eeep, still extremely grateful that vet clincs are open at this hour) the vet says that it doesn't seem like she's eaten anything toxic (indoor dog), but that she appears to be recovering from a seizure and it'll take a few hours and a good sleep for her to come back to it but she will not need any medication. He made a comment that totally threw me off and asked if there was any chance that she'd consumed any marijuana. I laughed and told him of course not because it was an absurd theory (MJ is not legal in my country for starters). 

I drive her back to my parent's house which is over an hour from where I've been living with her because I was scared about her health, and that's where her local vet is as well as a very reliable emergency vet that she'd been to every other time she'd been ill. On the drive home I begin to wonder if she'd managed to get into the brownies but I dismissed the thought because well, they're been pushed down the side of the couch and she's got an extremely picky appetite beyond imagination (no dry dog food, no homestyle, no casseroles, - dry cat food, pet mince, and canned loaf cut into squares are acceptable though (occasionally needs to be force fed per vet instructions if her stomach grumbles because she 'forgets to eat')). I tuck her into my childhood bed at my parents house, and watch her fall asleep while keeping an eye on her breathing for my fear that she'd have another seizure and would need to go back to the vet. 

I barely manage 2 hours of sleep and wake up soaked in dog piss. She was absolutely delirious so I took her for a walk to get some fresh air in her and by god I've never seen a dog prance so much while continuously falling over. It was like watching a baby fawn take its first steps. Anyway, as the day goes on she gets more and more psychotic, falling, barking at herself and howling more than she has in the past entire year while acting like she's an autistic screeching child. I noticed that if I covered her eyes she'd just lay down and fall asleep so I let her get some beauty sleep while I washed my bedding and mattress. 

A few hours later finally it's time to go back to our home (because someone needed to clean up the piss soaked bedding there too). We get home and finally all of my questions are answered. As I walked past the living room, the zip lock bag labelled ""THC Brownies DO NOT EAT"" was torn open on the floor with no brownies in sight. I didn't even check before I had swooped her off the vet! I was too preoccupied trying to carry her. 

I learnt a few lessons, the first being that I am a terrible doggy-parent, and the second being that cleaning two sets of mattresses, doonas, and sheets in the same day is absolutely anything but fun. Always keep your delicious edibles in a hard plastic container rather than a ziplock bag, don't make my mistake.

TLDR: Left some pot brownies on the couch, dog ate them and had the trip of a lifetime while I was deathly scared she was suffering from seizures. I had to clean my bedding at two different houses on the same day, mattress and all while running on 0.

TIFU By firing a pistol in the office,"Ok so this happened about an hourago and my ears are still ringing.


Without giving myself away, I works for a weapons attachment manufacturer, so as you would expect we have guns and facsimiles around the office a lot of the time.


I come back from the shop with my lunch to find a pistol at my desk, mag out with live blank rounds in the mag. I pick up the pistol and have a little look at it while I eat my sandwich.

So I'm looking at this pistol and notice the hammer is pulled back. I thought it was a little weird and didn't think anything of it, so I put it between my legs and pulled the trigger.....


Well someone had left a round in the chamber, the shock I got in that moment as well as the other 5 poor people (and dogs) I will never forget. Dogs running round like crazy and barking like mad, colleagues holding their ears a swearing like sailors and me, sitting red face with some tremendously brown pants...

Luckily they were too pissed, I got a talking to about always checking the chamber before pulling the trigger on a random pistol at my desk but other than that I just got made fun of for the next hour.

So now I'm sitting in another office writing this to you lot because my face is still too red from embarrassment to walk back in yet.

TIFU by not wearing eye protection,"This happened over 20 years ago, but I still cringe every time I think about it.

I was working alone in my computer repair shop one day when a PC that wouldn’t boot was dropped off.  I hooked it up and it just beeped, which told me there was a hardware issue.  After a bit I found the problem – one of the RAM slots on the motherboard had some bent pins.  Most likely someone had tried to add RAM and had forced a chip in there the wrong way.

This is where my FU happened.  I thought I could save the customer from having to buy a new motherboard by just bending the little metal pieces back into place.  I’d fixed bent CPU pins before and this couldn’t be any different, right?

I started bending the end back into place and the entire damn thing popped up out of the RAM socket and went right into my eye.  At first, I thought something had hit me in the face and just bounced off, but after a few seconds of pain I started to realize there was something still there.

My first thought was to treat it like an eyelash, so I started to move my eyelid around, to get it to fall out.  I succeeded in causing myself an intense jab of pain that dropped me back in my chair for a bit.  I decided I needed a mirror, which meant a walk to the restroom.  I put up the ‘back in 5’ sign, locked up and started walking.  I was trying very hard to not move my eye or blink and made it about halfway there before doing something that caused stabbing pain.  I dropped to my knees in the hallway and just stayed there for a while.  When I got up I was starting to think I might need to call an ambulance, but figured I should at least try to fix it on my own.

When I finally got to the bathroom I carefully pulled my eyelid down and immediately saw the culprit.  It was bigger than I had expected and, honestly, scared the crap out of me. I had a jagged piece of metal in my eye!  I again considered calling for help, but that would mean walking all the way back to the office to get to a phone.  I wasn’t sure I could manage that at this point, so decided to keep trying to remove it.

I spent what felt like a really long time (but turned out to be less than 15 minutes) holding my eye open, trying not to blink, seeing the metal piece vanish to the left and to the right, grabbing the counter top in pain repeatedly.  I finally managed to get it out, without damaging myself.  I kept it as a reminder to be more careful in the future.  And took a picture of it (on a tape measure for scale) to share:

TIFU by mangling myself on my first day at work,"Mandatory this didn't happen today...this happened shortly after I turned 16, I'm now 21.

As I had just turned 16, I got the ""you're old enough to get a job"" talk from my mom. I figured why not look for a job and applied to all the basic stereotypical first job fast food locations. None really piqued my sophisticated 16 year old interests, so I started to apply to local mom and pop shops. I ended up finding work as an assistant florist for a small family owned business. 

Now I love flowers and figured this was a pretty sweet gig. No difficult customer interactions, no heavy labor, no nonsense. I show up to my first day at work with great enthusiasm and eagerly began completing the tasks assigned to me...wash the vases.

The vases were clear and about 2 ft tall. The sink I was to wash them in was a standard kitchen sink. A little tricky to maneuver but nonetheless I felt confident in my abilities to wash dishes of any size and began washing the vases with gusto. 

This is where I fuck up...in my excitement to be a first rate employee and work efficiently, I was moving far too fast for someone as accident prone as myself. I dropped the vase. But I couldn't just let it fall. Oh no, I had to try to catch it. On the rebound. 
With both hands. I reflexively reach out to save the already shattered vase, grasping broken shards of glass with both hands. It took me a second to realize the massive fuckup I've just made. 

My boss, hearing the sound of glass breaking rushes in. In a very pitiful attempt to hide the evidence of my stupidity, I shove both of my hands under the stream of water, but this just adds to the horror as the water runs red. My boss runs over to see my hands. I nearly severed my ring finger. It's bleeding pretty heavily. My coworker (also a classmate) runs in and sees that I'm covered in blood and begins to hyperventilate. ""I faint at the sight of blood! I faint at the sight of blood! Oh God!""

I'm thoroughly embarrassed that when tasked with doing the dishes I manage to maim myself. I also feel really guilty that I broke a vase on my first day and now am now bleeding all over my boss' towels. My coworker's screams of terror weren't really helping me feel any better. I flush red out of embarrassment and suddenly my boss is screaming too. ""Oh she's gone red! She's gonna faint! Quick blow on her!"" So now my boss and his wife are fanning me frantically with their hands and blowing into my face. I start crying because what the actual fuck is going on...didn't really prepare for this. My boss has me sit down and calls my mom. My mom shows up minutes later, camera in tow, prepared to record my humiliation. I'm sitting down bloodstained, with tears rolling down my cheeks and my mom comes in with a big ole grin on her face. She is unsurprised I managed to bloody myself on my first day. She is very aware of my over inflated sense of self and debilitating clumsiness.

She drives me to the hospital where I'm told I need stitches for my ring finger. I also have a very unfortunately placed horizontal cut on my wrist from the vase that raises a few eyebrows from nurses who try to gently ask if that was there before the incident. The doc comes in to patch me up and fills my finger up with some nice numbing juice (can't be bothered to try to remember the correct word for numbing juice). Numbing juice works a charm and suddenly I'm not in pain anymore, but I'm still jacked on adrenaline and jittery from my massive screw up. For some reason this combination of adrenaline, embarrassment and jitters causes me to act insanely stupid. Impressed that I can no longer feel my finger I turn to my mother and bend my partially severed finger as far back as possible. ""Look ma! I bet I could rip my finger off!""

The doc is floored. He's giving me and my mom a ""wtf is this devil child doing?"" and says he's never had to tell a patient not to rip off their own finger and reminds me I haven't been medicated, just numbed. All this stupid is me. It's all me. He tells me to sit still, stop ripping off my finger and stop playing with my finger because we need a sterile environment. He sews me up, chuckling to himself.

I leave the hospital feeling ashamed of myself and vow to never return, so a few weeks later I take out my stitches myself too early. I just stick a bandaid on my finger and call it a day. No infection and only a faint scar.

TL;DR My first day at work I overestimate my dish washing abilities and drop a large vase. I try to save the falling vase, but only manage to grab it on the rebound...with both hands. I slice up both of my hands pretty badly on the vase and further embarrassment ensues at work and at the hospital.

Update: Wow guys...didn't expect this to blow up like this. I'm really chuffed my suffering could entertain so many of you. Also some clarification since I've seen quite a few comments expressing concern at my mom's decision to record me: we are a family of dark humor. I am a huge drama queen. For the entirety of my life, I've gaged the severity of a situation based on how others react to it. Thus if my mom freaks out, I will freak out more because mom is freaking out so it must be bad. If she's laughing and poking fun at me, it must not be too serious. I'll live to see another day. My mom is a saint, but a saint with dark, at times heretical humor. 

Update 2: Here is the photo of my finger today. Still looking for old photos of me in the hospital taken by my mom. If I can find those I will attach later. My scar is really not very impressive, most of the cut was directly over the natural crease of my finger joint. All the same, enjoy.

TIFU Cutting my own hair,"This happened last week.
My hair had got kind of long, and was making me overheat in the gym. Couldn’t be bothered to trek into town to barber and figured there was nothing to it, so thought I’d do it myself.

Found the clippers, and all was going well. Unfortunately, I then tried to “fade” the back in with a zero grading. Turns out this bit is harder than you’d think. I took a chunk out, and I mean a chunk. I now had a bald patch that was blatantly obvious, like a beacon of you will. 

I had work the next morning. Work wearing a white shirt. No biggie, I thought. I had the great idea of using black shoe polish to cover the bald patch enough so it wasn’t noticeable. This actually worked great and I was very pleased. Until I got hot as shit in work and started to sweat. The sweat, made the shoe polish run, and all of a sudden I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror and my shirt collar has turned black. 

Panic set in so I throw on a jumper, thus making me ten times hotter still. 

Then spent the rest of the day sweating like a something in a something to the point I thought I was going to pass out. 

TL;DR: Tried to cut own hair, messed up, tried to cover it up, messed that up, nearly passed out due to dehydration from sweating like a maniac.

TIFU by spraying spraypaint in my eyes,"I'm an 8th grade student in Art. Our current project is making spray paint trees from stencils we cut out of cardboard. So a few students and I go outside to start working on our projects. I grab a sheet of cardboard, some cans, my stencil, and paper. 

Things are going quite well. I've made a piece, and show it to my teacher. He says it's good, but I should go crazier. So I do. I'm working on another piece, feeling confident, and kind of not paying attention to my hands. I spray color after color in all sorts of directions. Then, I pick up the yellow can of spray paint, and spray. 

Oops. 

When I picked up the can, I didn't bother to look which way the hole actually was pointing. So, when I sprayed it, it sprayed right at my face. All. Over. My. Classes. ""Fuck"", I say. I then go inside to wash my face and glasses off. I swear to God, it took ten minutes to get the specks of my glasses using a towel with soap and water. What's worse, there are now a bunch of little scratches on my glasses. 

Seriously. I figure that it the Law of Natural Selection means anything, I will be dead before 21.

TIFU by forgetting to put the tailgate up on my work truck,"This happened a few weeks ago, just occurred to me that it might fit on this sub. 

I work for a landscaping company and this time of year is crazy as we are mulching and mowing, which means we’re all working 60-65 hour weeks. This happened on a Saturday at the end of our day, I was ready to get home and relax for the weekend, and we just finished up our last job. 

I hop in the truck, twist the key, and take off. Apparently, someone in the company noticed the tailgate was down and came running after me, but my weekend had begun and I wasn’t really paying attention. I took off down the road and took a hard right turn. For the first time in my journey , i decided to glance in the rear view. 

A wheelbarrow had just dislodged itself from the truck bed and was bouncing off the road. I slammed on the brakes and ran to retrieve it. It hadn’t even occurred to me that the tailgate was down, I just figured the wheelbarrow caught a bad bounce and popped out. When I returned to the truck , I realized that I had utterly fucked up. The 500$ backpack blower was gone, two tanks of gas, and a rake. 

I tore down the road and found all of the lost items , the blower was totaled, the gas cans had spilled everywhere, and the rake was bent to hell. All in all it cost my broke college self over 600$ to replace.

My boss hasn’t let me drive since.

TIFU Ordering from the US in Europe,"Today I fucked up.

So, a few weeks ago I ordered a nice tent from the US, because they are only produced in America and you can't find nice tents like this where I live for this cheap price. My order was about 150$. And above this price the shipping was free worldwide. I was really excited and could not wait till the tent arrived.

Today I got a letter from my local post office and was super excited because I thought that my package arrived....

But the only thing i found out, was that the package arrived in two parts and I had to pay 50€ tribute for both packages, in total about 100€, so the price went from circa 150€ to 250€.

TIFU by assuming that my coworker did more work than he did,"This was yesterday however consequences came a few minutes ago. Also on mobile please don’t flame.

I work at a tennis club most of my job is cleaning up the club and sweeping and lining the courts. I am 16 and I hate working there even though I only work Wednesdays and Fridays. It was also my first job and for some reason only one maintenance person works at a time which is stressful for a first job because nobody is telling me what to do I was told to clean up the place so I did that to my best ability.

My boss has called me before I went to work and then told me how important doing the outside courts was so when I got there I hightailed though the inside of the club and went outside. Another maintenance guy was there and basically told me that he had done the courts except for lining them and I had a late night so I was pretty tired. I saw that he was watering one court and he said he was going to hand water another (that court’s sprinklers were broken) so I assumed that all the courts were watered so I lined them only and finished my shift and went home. 

Next day I get a text saying that I left the sprinkler system off and then I said I didn’t water them someone else did and then my boss called me and basically told me that the other guy never watered the courts and he was removing my Wednesday hours this isn’t that first time I have “forgotten” to do stuff. I put quotes there because it’s usually stuff that I have never had to do before and now if I forget anything I am going to be fired. And I also owe my parents a lot of money so I am fucked.

TIFU by getting a piggyback ride,"More like me and my friend fucked up together as we were both at

But here's the stupid story! 
Me and my friend work as interns in an engineering firm and this weeks work was getting pretty rough so we decided to take a break, let out some steam and go clubbing in a Wednesday? Mistake #1

So we start drinking at my house, have a few merry shots and decide to walk to the club which is around a half hour walk. Mistake #2

On our journey my friend decides to offer me a piggyback ride, the courteous 6'3"" giant he is, and I'm 5'10"" and like twice as light as him so what could go wrong jumping on his drunken back? Obviously mistake #3

Not three steps into said promised relief of not having to walk for a bitteen my friend trips over his own feet and we both go plummeting forward. I go face down without a chance to register the danger and put my hands out. Ended up snapping my front teeth in half and spewing out blood like a wine box. 

Safe to say we never made it to the club as the bouncer would never let in a person (das me) looking like they just fought a bear with two half broken front teeth. My friend didn't look bad because he did manage to break his fall with his arms, but ended up snapping his radius in two places. 

Now we don't think we deserve to work as engineers and are considering pursuing a career in acrobatics and travelling the world as part of a circus!

TIFU by cutting my wrist,"Per usual this didn't happen today but exactly 3yrs ago from today. I work in residential construction as a gas fitter/technician and the fuck up begins precisely 1 month into my new trade. It was a bombing 100 degrees and 200% humidity in good ol' SC on this particular day. I was inside a house working on hooking up a gas range and realized I needed a part from the truck. I proceed to sweat every drop of water in my body out  on my walk out to the truck I drop the tailgate climb on in (that particular f-150 had a big camper shell over the bed). I'm hunched over and see the part towards the back. Now here's where my fuck up begins. Naturally the truck is full of stuff but me and my work partner keep it organized so there is a little path to get to the back. As I proceed down said path I go to reach the part and as I take my next step an extension cord happened to catch my boot and I fall hand out face first into everything. I then get up and that's when I get the worst pain I've ever felt sent to my brain and as I register that's it my wrist and look down I seen a puddle of blood building up on the sheet metal that we had. I fall out of the truck holding my wrist now yelling for my partner to come help me. Blood had begun to squirt and drip all over me. I knew at this time I had really fucked up because well it's my wrist and we all know about our artery's that reside there. Reallizing that I begin to frantically yell while bending my wrist back and holding it above my heart. My partner finally hears me and the guy weed eating his lawn down the street has too and ran over. The guy gets to me first before he can ask he sees the carnage I have strewn about and proceeds the throw up. At this time my partner gets there sees and starts panicking gets me a towel and helps me into the truck. I'm now starting to feel light-headed and am really panicking as my partner tells me he doesn't know where the nearest hospital is. I've now begun to have thoughts that I might bleed out here and die which causes me to start yelling for him to fucking drive. Thank God as we pull out of the neighborhood right across the street happens to be Roper St Francis little clinic. We park and go running in scaring the living daylights out of the 3 elderly ladies that are the nurse's. They start panicking and scattering as the doctor comes out and grabs me. He rinsed it with iodine wrapped it good and tells me that I will live that I missed the main artery by a ball hair's length but sliced the secondary one clean in half. I declined the ambulance because I was told I'd live and  I didn't have health insurance yet hooray! Partner got me to the hospital. They stiched me up and told me to see a hand specialist the next day. The next day I see the specialist and he tells me that I cut 3 tendons all the nerves for the right side of my hand and the secondary artery. I had to have immediate surgery. Four hours later I wake up with a huge lighting bolt scar starting from the middle of my palm going to a third of the way down my arm and about 60 stiches I think.  But everthing but the nerves were reattached and I was good to go. Still can't feel the whole right side of my hand to this day. 

TL;DR A hot ass June day at work tripped in the back of my work truck and fell wrist first on sheet metal and being really sweaty it cut me like butter.

TIFU and almost got fired for getting an answer to a question I didn't ask,"Got pulled into the office at work today as soon as I got there, never a good sign. Both my general manager and shift manager were present as it was important. 
Backtrack to yesterday when I was closing up the patio to the place I work before close with one of my co-workers. I was curious to as if this guy was gay or not and decided to ask him straight up. Conversation went as follows, M = me , C = Co-Worker
M: Hey *name* do you mind if I ask you a question?
C: Sure, what's up?
M: It's a little weird and it's not really work related. If it makes you uncomfortable you don't have to answer it.
C: That's not really work appropriate but the answer is yes.
M: Cool

That is the entire conversation that happened word for word. I was pulled into the office on account of harassment and discrimination in the workplace. I was given a written, oral, and final warning all in one. I understand that the question probably should have happened outside the workplace, but what are your thoughts on this? I don't have any bias against people of any kind and was just genuinely curious as I figured talking to him about anything would just strengthen the bonds between my co-workers or whatever. I didn't talk to him at all after that since we don't normally talk too much anyways but he seemingly avoided me all day today at work.

TL;DR - Began to ask my co-worker if he swung, was answered before I finished. Almost fired the next day for discrimination and harassment in the work place.

Edit: Update - Thanks for the advice. I'm a little slow when it comes to some of the more natural social aspects so sometimes I ask things that aren't too great.  I've only worked with him for a little and was trying to make small talk, but in hindsight it was pretty stupid. Other than that I live in an area where there's a large gay population and most people are super voiced about it which is probably what shaped my thoughts. It was inappropriate, but I was curious if it also seemed like enough to be considered harassment or discrimination. Someone at my last work had asked me (in hindsight he often asked me to go hiking and stuff with him and I later realized he actually had a thing for me) but I answered him and didn't realize it to be so much more different than any other question.

Edit: Update - Apologized to him about it in a one on one setting and he was super chill about it.

TIFU by trying to jump my car,"So I work at a small retail store that has a couple other stores in the area, and we source inventory from each other's stores. I was at one of the other stores grabbing product to move to my store today. I left my car's trunk open with the hazard lights on while grabbing the product and transferring it to my car. This was my first mistake, as I have a really old and shitty car. 

I'm about to leave, and turn my key in the ignition and the engine does that sad cough it does when it's like ""nah girl I'm done"". 

I call my coworker inside and ask her if she can help jump me. This is my second mistake.

She pulls her car up next to mine and we pop the hoods. I give her my jumper cables and say, ""You know what you're doing right?"" 

She's like ""Oh yeah dude for sure."" And connects the clamp thing (idk anything about cars, which is why I asked) to my battery. It immediately sparks and I'm like ""Are you sure you're doing this right??"" 

She says ""Yeah it does that sometimes no worries.""

She goes to start her car and the cables start sparking like crazy and smoking. I yell at her to turn her car off because ""AW LAWD JESUS WE ON FIRE"", but the damage has already been done.

At this point, the cables are stripping the rubber so hard off the wires it's like they needed money for tuition. 

Me, being a drama queen, assume this means the car is probably going to explode pretty soon. 

We run inside, and decide to call 911 because we don't know what to do \- (both cars are off at this time).

We panic and emphatically tell a coworker about the sparks and the melting rubber (This is mistake #3) as we're on hold (!!!!) with 911. The first coworker decides she's just gonna run over to the fire station since we're still on hold and ask for help, as it's literally less than 50 feet away from the parking lot we're in.

While I'm outside waiting for help and making sure the (now naked) wires don't spontaneously combust, the second coworker is connected with 911 and tells them we have a ""car on fire"".

About a minute later, my coworker and I are outside surrounded by several fully suited\-up firemen and women with gear, telling us a truck is on the way and asking where the fire is.

We, now fully aware that the cars are not actually going to explode, weakly point at the sad pile of melted rubber and exposed wire. 

An older, father\-like fireman gives us a stern talking to about false alarms and how they could charge us for this, and then proceeds to give us shit about not knowing how to connect jumper cables right. To which I quietly respond like the ashamed 12 year old I am inside, ""I actually didn't connect them at all so"". He laughs at us and tells us to keep the melted wires to remind us to ask for help next time and to not be such dumbasses.

We sent them pizza as a thank you. My car battery is dead and needs replaced, RIP in pieces.

TL;DR: I entrusted the help of someone who knew more about cars than I do, but I have rocks in my head. The fire department came.

TIFU... by getting a head start on moving out of my house.,"Apologies for any grammar mistakes, English is not my first language.

BACKSTORY:
I’ve lived in the same house for about six years with my big family and in 2 weeks I’m finally moving out. I’m going to have an in-law apartment (I think that’s what it’s called?) all to myself and when I heard the news yesterday, I was over the moon. Concurrently, I’m going through the most stressful finals week of my life.

WHICH BRINGS US TO TODAY:
Today I decided to get a head start on packing and empty out my bedside drawer, which has been in the same spot for the whole six years of my residence. I did this partly to clean up my space and partly to avoid studying, which I have been doing for the past week. I moved my drawer to the curb outside and gave it a pat, silently thanking it for its years of service. It was a pain and it took a long time, but I knew that I would be grateful later. Little did I know that I would very much regret my proactiveness in the near future.

Typically, I’ll have a cup of tea at night and set the mug on my drawer when I’m done. Tonight, being the creature of habit that I am, I made my nightly brew, settling in for a good long Netflix session to wipe away the stresses of finals week and soothe my throbbing brain.

I should mention that I have a sleep disorder which keeps me awake for long periods of time and at this point in our story I had been awake for about 25 hours. These bouts of sleeplessness also make me slightly delirious and forgetful, so when I finished my 10th consecutive episode of The Office, I absentmindedly set my mug on my bedside drawer. 

Hmm. That’s not what happened. What happened was that my hand passed through thin air, dropping and shattering my very favourite mug on the empty floor next to my bed. “Oh shit,” I thought, “I’d better clean this up.” I exhaustedly swung my legs to the floor and, without thinking, stomped directly on the shards of ceramic. 

The first thing to register in my broken mind was the realization of my own stupidity. Then, “HOLY FUCK OWWWWW.” I ended up smearing my foot blood all over the floor and rug in my room and had to pull out the shards with my sister’s tiny tweezers, Currently, I have wrapped my feet in gauze and Neosporin and the bleeding has quelled, but I have no idea how I’m going to walk tomorrow. 

TL;DR The combination of a new furniture arrangement and the delirium of an exhausted mind caused me to shatter and subsequently step on my favourite mug.

TIFU by punching my friend’s dad.,"     My friend invited me to join his family on one of their vacations to the beach. Today, the last day before the 6 hour ride home, we went to the beach. My friend’s dad is an army soldier and is trying to teach his son so he gets him to spar me in the water so we could do throws and fall.
    For a little bit of reference I had taken karate for years and my friend had never taken any kind of class. 
    I was being cautious, not hitting my friend hard and not trying anything dangerous. I was obviously outmatching him though and my friend’s dad went to show him a move. It went a little something like this:
    “Son, he’s doing all of this karate shit, watch this.” He then goes to do a tackle of sorts, yet I wasn’t prepared and instinctively lashed out and hit him in the face. The tackle hit and you could tell by the manner of it that he was pissed. 
    He squared up, before telling me that I was lucky I’m under 18. I apologized profusely and while he isn’t openly mad at me, you can tell he is still pissed off.
    Now I have to know every time that I see him I punched him, it wasn’t on purpose and I still feel really bad. He is the type to hold grudges, but I’m just hoping that he forgets.

TIFU by destroying my bike with a shirt.,"This happened last night, so more a ""Yesterday I Fucked Up"". 

I'm part of a group that organizes night bike rides, and yesterday I went in my first ride in over a month. 

Yesterday night I was in a bike ride, and during a short stretch of our route we had some drizzle that left my shirt damp. Since it wasn't cold, I hate damp clothes and I was wearing a wifebeater under it, I took the shirt off and tucked it in my belt.

I changed my belt recently and the new one is a bit loose, so the shirt wasn't as secure as it should have been. During the next four or so blocks, I kept on thinking ""I'll put it in my pannier in the next red light"". 

But there wasn't a next red light. What happened was that one of the arms of the shirt escaped my belt and got in the way of the chain and got stuck in both of the transmission gears, and the sudden change in tension broke one of the pieces that hold the gears in place. 

Yeah. Somehow a cotton shirt managed to break in half a steel piece. 

After an absolutely embarrassing quarter hour, two friends and mine managed to get out what was left of the shirt, disassemble the bike and get it and my ass on an Uber, and I went straight from there to the only repair shop open at the time, where they told me the repair will take around five days.

TIFU by ignoring an injury and advice about it,"Obligatory didn't happen today

So I've played baseball my entire life, I started in t-ball and played all the way through high school. It's the only sport I ever played and I love it, I had dreams and aspirations of going through college and making it as a baseball player. 

My junior year I went 9-0 with 3 saves and I was touching the high 70's with my fastball. Top it off that I'm left handed and I had a few college scouts from the state looking at me. First game of my senior year I injured my shoulder and couldn't throw for the rest of the season, I gave up baseball after that. Note it was not a huge injury I didn't need surgery or anything it was an impingement but it was bad enough it kept me from throwing at 100% all season.

Fast forward 12 years later, I hear from a friend that my town has an adult fast pitch league. I'm excited, my pro dreams are over but I can still play the sport I love in a competitive league. I join up and get picked up by a team to pitch right away. I'm a little rusty but I get it going after a few games and I'm doing well happy with how I'm throwing.

Second season I hurt my shoulder again, it's not as bad as high school but it seems like anytime I throw more than 20 pitches my arm tightens up like crazy and burns. I chalked it up to being really rusty and slightly out of shape and kept at it. A season later it's still happening so I see a doctor. He calls it another impingement and tells me to rest a few weeks, puts me in physical therapy, and tells me to lighten up my pitching load. I take 3 weeks off and go back, it's not better. I get referred to a specialist, he says there is a lot of fluid built up in my shoulder, gives me an injection and tells me to take a month off. 

At this point one of my best friends tells me to stop, she feels like something is really wrong and tells me I need to go back to the doctor and tell them to do an MRI to be sure. I ignore her, rest and go back to pitching. Finally it's getting to the point I can't throw a full game anymore so I start closing. Then our other pitcher calls in sick on game day one day. I throw the entire game, the other team decides to have a foul ball derby on me, I end up throwing over 200 pitches that game and that night I realize something is definitely wrong my shoulder is throbbing 8+ hours later. 

I see the specialist again, they decide to do an MRI just to give me some comfort because in their words ""if it was torn I'd know and I wouldn't be able to throw."" A week later I get the call, I have a nearly full tear to my supraspinatus, it was probably a small tear to begin with but over time I tore it more and more to the point that the tendon was frayed now. I undergo surgery and the surgeon tells my wife that my shoulder looked like a 60 year old man's shoulder (I'm in my early 30's.) I rest it and start PT 8 weeks later, shoulder not getting better with PT. They send me back, doctor determines that there is still an impingement in the arm but it's lower and the shoulder tear was only part of the issue, they believe I have a bicep injury and now I'm lined up for another surgery. Baseball days are long long over and over a year from the original injury I still experience at least some pain every day.


**TL:DR - Thought I could still pitch like a high schooler 12 years later, ignored best friend warning me to stop and demand an MRI, had 1 surgery and need another, shoulder will never be the same.**

TIFU physically standing up,"Technically, this was yesterday but I need to share this story. Sorry for the format, I am on mobile.

Last night I was watching TV with my parents and got injured in the dumbest way possible. I just happened to be wearing capri pants that have a folded cuff that is held in place by a loop and button. I tend to sit with one leg tucked up underneath me, a position I know I should avoid because my family has bad knees. 
So I decided to get up, and in the process my big toe got caught in the cuff of the other leg as I stood up. I fell hard. I was stuck and couldn't right myself. 
As I fell I caught myself on a yoga/exercise ball and it kept me from cracking my head against the piano bench. The ball only had so much give and it rolled slightly, causing my wrist to jam and hurting my shoulder. That was nothing compared to the pain in my knee, toe, and ankle. All three twisted/pulled before my knee hit the ground. 
My parents saw the whole thing and had no idea what happened. I tried to explain as I cried and tried to free my toe from the twisted denim of the cuff.

This morning I woke up with a lovely bruised foot and ankle. My knee and shoulder hurt. My ankle is most likely sprained and I feel like I am a super klutz. I can't even wear capri pants and stand up without getting injured.

TIFU by giving my 3yo Chilli Tomato sauce by not reading the label correctly,"Ok, so end of last month my wife went out of town to celebrate the life of her late father (dad passed away after a long MND struggle).

TIFU by playing with matches while drunk,"Mandatory, this happened last Saturday, now it is Wednesday and I've just come out of hospital.

So it was Saturday afternoon on a pleasant summer day and my family had organised a BBQ with some family friends. 

My Dad and I were in charge of lighting the BBQ and cooking the food. This is where the mistake happens. To light the BBQ I got some old newspaper and put a bundle of 10 or so matches in to make sure the paper stays alight in the wind. Anyway my Dad comes out with a chimney lighter, a metal cylinder with holes in to light the charcoal a bit easier. The BBQ gets lit and I put the bundle with matches down.

A few hours later after everyone's has had their food, we were well into drinking. I've had some beers and had moved on to vodka lemonade, more vodka than lemonade. It starts to get dark and my Dad suggests to light the chimineer. This is where that bundle comes in. I go to light the chimineer with the paper and forgetting that there were matches in it. 

The fire gets to the matches and it bursts into flames, catching my jacket on fire. I grab the nearest glass, which had whiskey in it, to put the fire out but it made it worse. The whole left sleeve set alight. I managed to put out the fire but my while forearm was burned.

I went to A and E, and had to have a skin graft to my arm as it was burned that bad.

TIFU by putting my hand in a belt and pulley moving at 700 RPM,"Obligatory ""this did not happen today.""

I'm a fairly frugal guy, so about two years ago I stopped taking my car to the mechanic, reason being that I could figure stuff out on my own and save a bunch of money.

Most annoying thing about my car is that the serpentine belt makes a ton of noise.  I decided that I would use some ""belt conditioner"" to see if that helped before I just replaced the belt completely.  Well it wasn't working, I'd spray it on, start the car, and it would still scream and screech.  So, having a re\-evaluation and thinking that I can outsmart this dang belt, I decided to spray it on... with the car running and the belt moving.  This way it would get even coverage and voila! the car would run like a whisper.

It worked well, except for the fact that it was making a bit of a mess of my engine bay.  Looking back over my shoulder to look where I put my rag, I placed my hand on the radiator support.

This is where it all went wrong.

As I turned further to look for my rag, my hand slipped quickly off the radiator support and right to the belt and pulley.  Before I even realized what happened the belt had pulled two of my fingers underneath it and threw them around the pulley.  I'm not sure if the pain or the sound was worse... have you ever heart a t\-shirt being shot out of a t\-shirt cannon? THOOOOOF!

Immediately it dawned on me that if I looked down I would see a hand with two freshly degloved fingers.  Deciding that I didn't want to see that... I immediately grabbed my rag (hey at least I found it) and grabbed my throbbing hand with it, learning now that I dislocated my index finger, and suddenly relocated it by grabbing it with the rag.  I also noticed that I had now turned my white oil\-stained rag into a red oil\-stained rag.

I tracked down my phone and called someone to come and pick me up, trying to stay calm and not freak them out, and decided that sitting down and waiting was probably a good idea (ultimately ended up taking a bit of a dazed and confused nap on the driveway while I waited).

Went to the ER for X\-rays and some superglue.  Also got a free side of scrubbing the crap out of my fingers with what I believe to be the coarsest brush known to man.

Surprisingly no broken bones, and no significant damage, but I do have a extra thick index finger that has a bit of a twist to it now, and not much feeling on the tip of my my middle finger at most times.

I'm fortunate because this could've ended way worse than it did.  Glad I still have my fingers and \*most\* of the skin.

TL;DR: I didn't pay attention and let my hand meet a moving serpentine belt and pulley.

TIFU by making a pedophile joke in an elementary school,"Obligatory not today, but last Friday.
I’m currently a high schooler, and last Friday I went to the elementary school to teach the children about making wet mounts (Microscope slides). During my teaching I encountered a kid that graduated a few years ago, we were joking around a I made a few comments about how he looked like a pedophile. At the time I thought nothing of it, and continued with my day. Fast forward to today: I get pulled from class by the school principal and taken to his office. He asks me about the pedophile jokes and I confess. I get written up, and the write up is sent to every teacher in the school. As a result, I have an NHS review tomorrow (I’m going to get kicked out). I also have been kicked off of the robotics team of which I am a captain, and am no longer eligible for a summer water testing internship which I was extremely excited for. 
TL;DR: Made some pedophile jokes to an old classmate, got kicked out of all my extra curriculars and stripped of all formal titles.

Matthew was speaking to a pre-student teacher that he knew was a recent graduate of HIGH SCHOOL. Matthew inquired why he was here. When the college student told him he was going to school to be a teacher, Matthew replied that he (college student) was a pedophile. He continued, if he Googled the definition of pedophile, he would see a big colored picture of (college student). He also told him that he probably keeps candy in his white pedophile van."" CONSEQUENCE: When this information was shared with Matthew, he stated, ""I'm going to deny that"". Then the principal said, ""Really""? Then Matthew stated, ""okay I said it"". In addition to being offensive to the college student and concerning to the elementary principal, Matthew appears to be struggling to understand appropriate behavior, language, and humor in the context of the school setting. Especially in an elementary school when you are a guest and representing, the SCHOOL Science Department and teachers. Future behavior of this nature will result in progressive discipline. It is advised that Matthew writes 3 separate letters of apology; 1) to Principal OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL , 2) College Student, and 3) to his HIGH SCHOOL Science Teacher.

TIFU by inhaling copious amounts of bugspray. Indoors.,"By today, I mean about ten minutes ago. Currently resting it off in bed. Some background info:

I’ve been hanging out a bit outside lately (unavoidable, unfortunately), and we have had a lovely variety of bugs hanging around, leaving miserable itching in their wake. Now, I have never had much of an issue beyond the usual mosquito bite, but for some reason this year I’ve been breaking out into full on allergic reactions to these fuckers (they may not be mosquitos, I wouldn’t know either way) every time they bite me. Even worse, at least one has managed to follow me inside, meaning that even while I sat indoors studying all day today, I got bit even further, and broke out into even more irregular, itchy bumps. 

So after about a day and a half of this, sitting in the theater watching Deadpool 2 and covered in topical Benadryl, I get the bright idea to use a little bugspray tonight before I go to bed, so that I can at least have some peace while I sleep. I’m washing the sheets tomorrow anyways, so what’s the harm in it?

Well, the harm in it is me being a fucking dumbass at 12:30 in the morning, that’s what. 

I take the can of bugspray- no, not the bottle that spritzes out a little liquid like a perfume bottle every time you pump it, this is a can of heavy-duty spray with a non-stop nozzle of pure, noxious, bug-repelling fumes- *into the fucking bathroom*. Not outside, not even into a larger room with more circulating air and/or better ventilation. I take it into the bathroom, take a big breath and hold it (at least I had a modicum of sense left), and go ham. This procedure works fine, and I coat my exposed (apparently delicious) skin in half a minute. Here comes the fuck-up. 

I breathe out a sigh of relief at the thought that no more bugs would feast on me tonight. Then I breathed back in. 

I had just filled a tiny bathroom with loose bugspray fumes, with the door closed, and I inhaled a wallop of it.

I immediately started coughing and retching, and instead of thinking to *open the fucking door and leave,* I CONTINUE to breathe in the same shit while I tried desperately to rinse my mouth out with water, because it *tasted bad,* and that’s all I could think to do??? I finally bumped my shoulder into the door and remembered it was there, and opened the damn thing, stumbling out onto the landing where the dog and cat were watching me, curious as to what the fuck all the racket was about. I breathed fresh air like I had just been drowning, and continued coughing, feeling a bit like a human can of bug spray every time i did so, tasting the particles all over again. I finally pulled myself up and went downstairs to get a glass of water and mull over my abysmal life choices. It was at that point that I thought, “*god* I fucked up...” And the rest is history! 

I’m off to google the short and long term side effects of excessive bug spray inhalation. Wish me luck! 

TL;DR Got bit by bugs, tried to bite back by spraying a can of bugspray inside a tiny bathroom and breathing in. A lot. Like, a lot a lot.

TIFU by shipping my keys two hours north,"All right, so mandatory that this happened today/last night and I'm posting now because I just got home.  I work for a major shipping company in the evenings, loading their outgoing semi trailers.  There's no AC or anything, so it gets seriously hot, and I'm in Florida, so that doesn't help.  To combat this, I brought a cooler full of iced towels, and put my keys in the cooler, to keep all my stuff together.  I then tucked the cooler way up under the conveyor belt, so that it was out of the way.

I start my shift normally at 5:15 PM; taking packages off the belt, and scanning and loading them into my truck.  However, as the shift goes on, my trailer starts getting absolutely blown out by the volume of packages coming my way.  When that happens, I end up with haphazard piles of boxes on either side of the belt, and inside my truck.  I have to wait for a lull in order to catch up and make everything organized.  

I go through the ebb and flow of feast and famine, and suddenly realize that I'm not going to be able to get all of the packages in my 40 foot trailer.  I signal to a supervisor that I'm going to need a second trailer, and do what I can with the little space I have left.  

A supervisor comes up and tells me to move 50 feet further up the belt, to an empty trailer, and that he will finish loading what packages are already outside that trailer.  I refuse initially, because he didn't have a scanner, and I needed to ensure that all of the packages were for my trailer, and that none had slipped by the other trailers further up the belt.  He insists that he will take care of it, and sends me on my way.

I go down to the new truck, taking only my scanner and load everything there as quickly as possible.  I finish up everything around 10:15, and go back up to my original truck to grab my water and my cooler, which I left well outside my trailer.  However, the cooler is now gone.  

Panicked, I go to my supervisor to ask if he threw my cooler into the trailer before he sealed it.  He says that he doesn't remember.  I quickly go to his manager and ask her if they can open that original trailer, so I can make sure that my cooler isn't on it.  She tells me that the trailer has already left for the other hub, which is roughly 2 hours north.

Now, I'm concerned and absolutely incredulous about what seems to be happening.  I start vigorously searching the entire surrounding area, hoping that someone just moved the cooler.  No dice.  My manager, meanwhile, has called the person driving the truck, so that when he stops, he can check to see if it's in there.  Around 11 PM, we hear back that the cooler is indeed in his trailer, and tells me that he'll back at our hub at 1:30 AM.  

Ok, that sucks, but it's only a couple hours away, so I wait on it.  In the meantime, I get help from a couple other employees who were handy with a screwdriver and coat hanger, and we break into my car, so I can at least have my wallet and cell phone.  Around 2 AM, I get a call from the driver, saying that they've routed him to a different city that's about 3 hours away, and that his new ETA is 7 AM.  

I now have no easy way home, and no way to get into my apartment, if I were to get home, so I make up my mind to sleep on the floor of the break room for a couple of hours.  I fitfully sleep, only to wake up to a new message, that his new ETA is 9:30 AM.  At this point, I have to call in to my other job, since I'm not going to make it on time.  

Finally at 9:45 AM, the driver arrives and I get my keys back.  Tomorrow, I will probably get written up at my other job for missing today, and I got roughly two hours of sleep last night.  And I have to work tonight again.

TL;DR: I made the mistake of not keeping my keys on my person at all times and was stranded at one of my jobs for 12 hours after my shift ended.",8,6/6/2018 15:39,tifu,Mad-_-Doctor,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8p14yo/tifu_by_shipping_my_keys_two_hours_north/,/r/tifu/comments/8p14yo/tifu_by_shipping_my_keys_two_hours_north/,8p14yo,"There should be someone connected to your building that has keys to your apartment.

TIFU by ruining my sister's life,"When my younger sister was 12, she came to stay with me at university for a few days. I thought she was old enough to stay home on her own, so one night I went out with my friends and stayed out all night. I left her.

When I was 16, my uncle tried to molest me. I pushed him away and he never tried again, but I never told anyone. Then, when my younger sister (7 years younger) was 16, he tried the same to her. She told me as we were leaving. What should an older sister have done? Stayed with her that night obviously. What did I do? Went out to meet my friends as I had already made plans. Later I confronted my uncle with the nastiest venomous rage I had and told him if he ever touched a girl again I would bury him. I think it did the job. He was incredibly frightened and started losing weight rapidly after that and is a measly fragment of the man he once was now.

Next year my sister goes to university. She becomes very depressed. I pick her up one day, and have friends in my car even though she feels very uncomfortable being around people. The friends are smoking (a big no no in my family). We get home and my dad smells smoke on my sister and is very upset. She doesn't defend herself. I don't defend her. I don't tell the truth because I don't want to get in trouble either. I let her take the blame, in her depths of depression.

Fast forward to the next year, my sister gets diagnosed bipolar. She blames everyone in our family (there are other dysfunctional relationships that I won't get into now) but also blames me, saying I'm a shitty selfish sister.

She's right. I am a fucking horrible waste of a person. I deserve to be stigmatised and judged and tormented. Not her. She doesn't deserve any of it. I fucking did this to her. I could have been there for her and I wasn't.

I'm 33 now and I carry this guilt around with me. I'll never forgive myself for what I've done to her. I don't know what to do.

TL;DR I'm looking back on all the shitty things I did as an older sister and consumed by guilt.

TIFU by not realizing triple sec had alcohol in it.,"Obligatory this happened years ago and not today.

I was 18 and up late, prime time for raiding my dad's alcohol. My mom let me have some of her margaritas when we went out to eat together, so I knew I liked them, and I knew my dad had tequila and triple sec. So I got some limes on the way home from work, looked up a quick recipe, and tried to make one myself.

I didn't know what the fuck I was doing, and filled the glass halfway with tequila, a little triple sec, and a little lime. Being 18 and not used to drinking, it was strong as fuck. Like, unbearably strong. This is where the very simple fuck up starts.

I had no idea triple sec had alcohol in it. I thought it was similar to simple syrup, and just used to flavor drinks a certain way. I took a couple swigs and put in more triple sec and lime. Still strong. Few more swigs, more triple sec and lime. *Still* strong. I was out of limes at this point, so I just kept pouring in more and more triple sec, dying to make the alcohol taste go away. And it did.

After the first few pours, I quit tasting the alcohol. Success! I still hadn't finished even half of the drink, but I went to sit down, content that I'd finally made a margarita. I started feeling a little *too* drunk. I decided it would be best to have a lie down, so I poured the rest of the drink out so no one would know what I was up to, and tried to sleep. I felt so dizzy, and the world kept spinning, and my stomach felt funny. Before I could register what was happening, I projectile vomited all over my bedroom floor. Shit.

I wobbled to the bathroom, feeling another vomiting spell coming on, but it wasn't coming right away so I laid down on the floor. Big mistake. After a couple minutes, the waves of nausea grew and grew, until it was time for upchuck #2. Except I was so drunk I couldn't hoist myself up off the floor. I did a half push up and puked again, this time all over the tile, and registered that I was feeling so *cold*. Like, chilled to my bones. So I did the only logical thing and laid in my own warm, wet vomit.

Several more minutes passed and I still wasn't feeling better. In fact, I was feeling *worse*. I was in and out of consciousness and was having trouble breathing. It was like I had to focus on each breath to make sure I didn't stop. I was confident I was at death's door. In my tshirt and underwear, I grabbed my cell phone and called 911 *on myself*. I ran out into the front lawn, still barely clothed, so that whoever was coming wouldn't have to knock on the door and wake my dad up. I remember I felt *so* guilty, and was crying on the phone with the 911 operator. It was about 4am at this point.

A cop car showed up with the fire department paramedics. I was sitting cross legged in the middle of the walkway leading up to the front door, and a policeman walked over and asked me what my name was, and how old I was. The conversation went something like this.

""Hi, how are you doing?""
""Not very good officer, I'm sorry you had to come out here, but thank you for asking.""
""Oh, it's ok. How old are you? What's your name?""
""I'm ______, and I'm 18.""
""Ok, are your parents home?""
""My dad is. He's asleep right now and I didn't want to wake him up. I know I'm a mess, I'm so sorry.""

At this point one of the paramedics helped me into the back of the ambulance. My mascara was smudged all over my face, I had tear streaks on my cheeks, and overall I looked like a hot mess. The paramedic was doing his best not to laugh.

""I'm sorry for laughing ma'am, it's just that I've been there a few times myself.""
""Oh no it's totally fine, if I were you I'd probably be laughing too, I know I'm messed up.""

My dad was woken up at 4am to see his 18 year old daughter drunk off her ass in the back of an ambulance. They sent me back inside and told me to get some sleep. My dad wasn't mad, he was more amused than anything, but I know my step mom stormed out declaring she didn't want to be associated with me anymore.

Believe it or not, tequila is my favorite alcohol of choice now. Except now I know triple sec isn't just a mixer.

Tl;Dr: didn't know triple sec was alcoholic and poured a shit ton into my drink, thinking it would help dilute it down. Got drunk and laid in my own vomit, then called the cops on myself.

Edit: some common things I'm seeing asked.

The triple sec was 24% ABV. I have my own bottle of it now and can read the label.

I started drinking around 1am, the story ends at 4am, so obviously I had some time to sober up a *little* and call the cops on myself.

I don't remember how I remembered all this.

The EMT asked me if I wanted to go in to the hospital for observation, and said it wouldn't be a bad idea. I told him no knowing it would be expensive, so he let me go.

TIFU by not drinking enough water and becoming intimately acquainted with a national monument.,"Obligatory ""this wasn't today"" disclaimer here, but it's approaching summertime so it feels like an appropriate time to share this story.

A couple of summers ago, I went on a trip with my parents and a couple of other family members to Washington, D.C. in August. For anyone who doesn't know, D.C. is August is hot as fuck. I knew this-- I had been during a couple of other summers, and I grew up in a nearby state so I'm used to the relentless southern summer heat/humidity. That summer alone, I had been running 3 miles a day in 98 degree heat with absolutely no issues, so even though I knew it would be hot, I didn't really take it into consideration too much.

Our first day there, we're wandering around visiting some sites while waiting to meet up with my sister, who was driving down from Pennsylvania. We had been walking around for probably a couple of hours when we decided to stop by the World War II memorial. I hadn't visited D.C. in a few years so this was my first time seeing it, and it's honestly a [really beautiful memorial](https://www.nationalparks.org/sites/default/files/styles/wide_1x/public/wwII_A8BG75.jpg) (take note of that pool in the middle, it becomes relevant).

So anyway, we're doing our tourist-y things, taking pictures, blah blah blah. My dad wanted a picture of all of us in front of the reflecting pool, so he got a nice gentleman to take a picture with my new-ish $550 camera that at the time, was probably the most expensive thing I owned. Right after taking that picture, I remember feeling suddenly lightheaded and saying to my mom ""let's just sit here for a bit until we hear from [sister]."" My mother tried to tell me that ya know, popping a squat beside the reflecting pool of a national memorial with no benches is probably frowned upon, but I was already down. Like, really down.

The next thing I remember is feeling like I was literally caught in the middle of white water rapids. I was wet and I was rolling around and I couldn't figure out why I having this weird dream when I had just been awake. And then I realized that I had passed out. And fallen. Into the reflecting pool. At a crowded monument. But we're not done. I just so happened to be visiting on the same day as a group of Naval petty officers, who immediately saw my dumb ass fall into the pool and immediately rushed over to help. Also, I had my camera around my neck at the time, so that managed to fall into the pool with me and fuck up the lens. I 100% knew that it was just from dehydration/heat exhaustion, so all I wanted to do was drink some water, crawl into a hole, and die. But nope. I, unbeknownst to me at the time, had also managed to smack my head against the bottom of the pool, so I had a giant bleeding bump on my head on top of everything else. Oh, and when I attempted to drink the water that was provided to me, I immediately vomited it back up INTO THE POOL literally 6 inches from the sign that read ""Please respect our veterans."" Dehydration + loss of consciousness + bleeding head wound = several Naval officers calling an ambulance, getting rolled away from a tourist attraction on a gurney, and sitting in the ER waiting room for 3.5 hours in soaking wet clothes, bleeding from the head, only to have the doctor check you out and tell you to drink more water. And then walking around D.C. for the next several days with a bashed in head, black eye, and just generally looking like I had gotten into (and lost) a bar fight.

TL;DR Didn't drink enough water, ended up desecrating a national monument, breaking an expensive camera, and getting stuck in a hospital for 5 hours.",324,6/5/2018 15:41,tifu,pnkypoint,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8orcc9/tifu_by_not_drinking_enough_water_and_becoming/,/r/tifu/comments/8orcc9/tifu_by_not_drinking_enough_water_and_becoming/,8orcc9,That was you!

TIFU by getting drunk and attempting to hide it from my mum,"Obligatory this happened a long time ago, not today.

The first time I got drunk I was 15.  I've been 6 feet tall since I was 14, and always looked older than my years, so I got into a night club without an ID check, and as I was new there some folks made friends with me and we got into rounds.

I must have had about 6 pints of beer and a few glasses of other stuff.  I don't really remember the walk home, except for a few flashes where I was cooling down my face using a chainlink fence I held onto with a death-grip while on my knees.

I kind of remember getting home safely and sneaking (the way a paralytically drunk person sneaks) into my room, whereupon I passed out on the bed.

Cue the next morning when I woke up on my side in bed, on top of my quilt, with about 3 pints worth of vomit all around me.  It. Was. Everywhere.

I knew my mum would kill me if she found out, so during my first and most terrible hangover of my young life I ended up bundling the entire quilt up and hiding it in the wardrobe.  Of course, the smell of vomit doesn't really go away even when bundled into a wardrobe.

I came home from school, and my mum grabbed me by the throat.  That was the first hint that something might be a little wrong.  My mum is 5""6', and she was so angry she managed to lift me off my feet about an inch.

She had found the duvet by smell alone, venturing into my room to see what the heck it was.  She pulled it out of the wardrobe, not knowing there was a veritable pool of vomit in the thing, and sprayed my putrid regurgitations all over herself in the process.

She gently, but firmly, advised me that I should proceed to tidy my room and remove all traces of the vomit, on pain of death.

So, I turn into the most evil person when I play the Sims. I like watching my sims suffer. 

A few years back, Arrested Development season 4 left me disappointed and I decided to punish the characters the moment Sims 4 City Living came out.

Turned out someone had already made the Bluth family except Maeby because of sims household number limit and uploaded onto the gallery. I downloaded and moved them into a crappy apartment where the trait was “things are easy to break” in this apartment.

Thanks to whoever that created these sims. The personalities aligned almost exactly the same as the TV show characters and before I knew it I was watching my own Arrested Development show. I didn’t think it would be that realistic and I controlled very little about what happened.

I only gave two beds, one bathroom, a piano, a grill at the balcony and other basic household items with a crappy TV. There was a neighbor and I made her Lucille II. I deleted all the money and made Michael work for the whole household spendings. George Michael would go to school and did a part time job.

Michael would be tired all day from working.

Buster would play the piano all day and everyone would become annoyed with it.

Nobody cared about GOB.

Lindsey and Tobias did not do anything but fight for the stuff. 

George Michael would clean up all the dishes and pick up the mess made by everyone else.

George senior would try to flirt with his wife Lucille but fail to get laid. 

I made Lucille throw a drink in Lucille II’s face and they fought. 

Everyone was going crazy. So, I decide to give them a break by sending them to a vocation. I sent them to a cabin from Get Together and everyone was having a nice time. 

GOB decided to join the fire pit where others were roasting marshmallow and stuff. He caught on fire (lol he’s a magician, ironically) and nobody cared. It was a bug! Your sims are supposed to freak out and try to put the fire out or call the fire department. The one who’s getting caught on fire should run to the shower and put themselves out but since they were at a rented cabin and not their home, it bugged out.

GOB was running around and everyone was relaxing. The Grimm reaper came and I made Michael beg but it didn’t work and everyone went onto having a nice vocation afterwards.",CA[deleted],163,36:05.6

My friend for whatever reason thought it would be fun to walk to his desk and push the model off, so he did. Well the big kid didn't take this one so well, he grabbed him by the waist and basically suplex'd my friend on the floor.

So the background to this event was that my girlfriend was working in Singapore and I was going out to meet her for four weeks holiday. We hadn’t seen each other in three months as I was working in the UK and had plans to explore the island for a week and then visit a few neighboring countries.

In the run up to this she had told me how she’d tried visiting a sex shop a few weeks prior but was too creeped out by the reactions of the customers and staff to browse in peace so she left without buying anything. Therefore
I decided to be the gentleman and purchase her a present before I left. As I was packing light for adventure travel I had taken off the packaging and wrapped it up in a T-shirt which I had then stuffed in the bottom of my bag. 

I was flying business with a Middle Eastern airline from London on a staff travel ticket kindly arranged by friend of mine who is a pilot for the airline (to make matters worse his dad is also a senior employee). Flying staff business on a friends account is a sensitive issue as you have to dress well (no jeans or trainers, suit jacket recommended etc) and be on your best behavior - ultimately it’s his reputation that gets burned if you’re an asshole.

Rather than just change planes at the Middle Eastern hub, I was going to enter the country for a couple of days and hang out with my friend who was desperate for visitors. Therefore my backpack couldn’t be sent on and had to be collected. As I grabbed it off the conveyor belt I noticed that there were two large cable ties attached, one was blue and the other yellow or green, I don’t remember. I didn’t know what to make of it so I bent them back and down between my back and my bag so they weren’t dangling wildly as I walked and proceeded to exit through customs. 

-I need to add that I really hate going to certain Middle East countries, I’ve been out there a few times before and the thinly veiled totalitarian theocracy just makes me feel on edge. I’m not a big fan of religion in general and the idea of falling afoul of a belief system I regard as made up and a blight to humanity really irks me, especially as you can’t expect fair treatment from their legal systems.

There was a single bored looking guard posted at the exit watching people walk by. I nodded at him as I walked past and he ignored me in return. Just as I was about to  exit, a door I hadn’t noticed flung open and two armed guys run out and start sprinting down the hall. “Someone’s about to get fucked” I thought. Turns out that person was me. 

To my shame they grabbed me in front of loads of passengers and marched me into what I guess was some sort of search/interrogation room. They started emptying my bag with ruthless efficiency and then the dildo landed in the middle of the table. The situation was so bad, standing their in silence with 2 or 3 angry Arab customs officials glaring at me.

“WHAT. IS. THIS?” the main official demanded angrily, picking it up by the edges of the battery compartment, holding it like one would tentatively pick up a soiled item of clothing found on their lawn . “YOU DO NOT BRING THIS INTO OUR COUNTRY”.

I can’t recall precisely what was said next but basically I was accused of being a homosexual degenerate (their words not mine), bringing indecency to their fair land and they wanted to know who I was meeting and staying with (the son of one of their national airlines most senior employees...this was sooooo bad, my worst nightmare was coming true and I was going to land my innocent friend and his family in shit and possibly cost them their careers). They told me of the consequences of such actions in their local law (jail!?) and then my mind started to disassociate and sort of float inwards and away from the situation and I don’t remember too clearly what was said after that.

Then they left the room, came back after a few minutes gave me a summary bollocking and then to my huge relief said I could go. I didn’t hang about.

I felt obliged to warn my friend but he laughed it off and said things would be fine. I’ve been back a few times without major incident but was almost refused onward boarding on my next visit as chinos and a Barbour jacket was deemed “not smart enough”. Still, totally worth it for that cheap staff travel fare. 

P.S. my bad luck didn’t end there. On my second day in Singapore my girlfriends crazy old Singaporean step grandma “Auntie” searched my bags when we were out getting lunch, discovered my malaria pills and thought they were drugs and threatened to call the police unless I left the flat (did someone say death penalty?). Also our bus skidded off the road and almost went off a cliff at 2am in the middle of nowhere during a 12 hour ride through a cyclone in the Philippines. Also we tried to do some cave tour in Palawan with a forged permit (the office in Puerto Princessa was closed for an entire week due to holidays) which backfired horrifically and the tour guide ran off into the jungle when the officials at the entrance of the cave threatened to call the police on him. Never saw him again. I also got fired a month after I got back to work, but that’s because my ex-boss is a terrible human being. This is also not the worst thing that’s happened to me, I once accidentally summoned a drug lord to our accommodation on a school trip to Kenya but that’s a tale for another day.

TLDR; I was transporting dildo from London to Singapore but accidentally took it through the customs of a Middle Eastern country and was detained roughly and publicly, threatened and accused of spreading homosexuality in their country, but fortunately was eventually released without further incident.

Also apologies for any poor spelling and grammar, my parents moved around a bit when I was younger and having to change national curriculums twice meant I missed out on some key schooling and consequently never had the confidence to write and post things online but I felt like getting over that today. 

Edit 1: wow this is really blowing up. Thank you for all the kind comments and questions, I’ll try and respond to some more in the morning but I really need to get some sleep in my van whilst I can. Currently playing a game of cat and mouse with the rangers of Darwin, Australia. Stakes are $150 and I don’t want to lose!

Edit 2: Can’t sleep, mind is too active now. Firstly, if you guys can all hold on til tomorrow night I’ll write up my Kenyan story. As a bonus I’ll try and write up a third bout of misfortune (on the weekend when it’s allowed) concerning the time I almost died of dysentery to at 16,000 ft in India and then got forced into a 12 hr binge by the people supposedly driving me to safety. Also I’m well aware of the blasphemy laws of the country I visited, what I didn’t know was that my bag was not going all the way to Singapore.

TIFU by chopping off my fingertip. Again.,"This didn’t happen today, but in the last 24 hours, so I think it counts. Last night. 

I chopped off the end of my middle finger on my left hand, while chopping up leeks for dinner. Dammit. 

I chopped off the end of my index finger a couple of months ago and was just remarking to myself the other day how well it had healed. I guess I was tempting fate.  Dammit. 

I chopped off the end of my thumb a couple of years ago (so I’m current on tetanus, yay).  Dammit. 

Whoever said “a sharp knife is a safe knife” is full of shit, man.  A dull knife might have just made a cut instead of going all the way through. 

Fucking knives, man.  I’ve got nobody to blame but myself, really. I’m a fucking idiot. 

And my kids just laughed at me. Dammit.

TIFU by trying space cakes in Amsterdam,"So as with most TIFU, this wasn't today but rather two years ago when me and a couple of friends were out interrailing through Europe. Also worth noting is that I have smoked weed before in my life, and sometimes gotten pretty fucked up too, so I figured I had some kind of tolerance at least.

Boy was I wrong.

Now, what I didn't know back then was that apparently, pot brownies and these so-called Space Cakes are two very different things. A pot brownie is a brownie with some pot in it, a Space Cakes is pretty much Hasch with a little bit of cake mixed in. They sold these devilish creations in small boxes, and as we were about to pay I noticed on the back there was a warning label reading something like >""Extremely potent product, caution is advised for amateur cannabis users!""< We kind of discarded it as a joke, and thought no more of it. These things were basically chocolate cupcakes, so we didn't think it could be that bad and proceeded to quickly devour them.

And just as we were finishing the last crumbs, one of my friends says to me ""go get two more"". First I think he's joking, but I notice he's not laughing. So I figure if he wants some kind of spiritual journey tonight, who am I to stand in his way. As I'm about to leave, the others tell me to buy so we can roll a joint as well. At this point, I remember thinking maybe this was a bad idea, but what the hell it's our last day in amsterdam. When I get back my friend downs his two cakes and I begin to (try) to roll a joint. I have only seen people roll joints, never done it myself so as one would imagine it's not going very well. After utterly obliterating what must have been half of the rolling papers, I finally get some feeling for it. As I start to roll what might be the ugliest joint since the dawn of mankind, I get the feeling that I've been doing this shit for hours. My body grinds to a halt and I slowly look up at the rest of the table and notice all of my friends sitting frozen, like wax sculptures, watching me roll this abomination. Oh shit, the cakes had started working their magic.

I finish the joint and it kinda looks like a flaccid dick, you gotta hold this poor bastard with both hands for it not to fall into pieces. I take two hits and then realize what a fucking stupid idea this is and proceed to pass it along to my friends. Fast forward about 30minutes more and we're having a hard time even forming a fucking sentence, let alone hold a conversation. We decide the best course of action is to get some food and then head back to the hostel.

We knew there was a McDonalds close by, so that felt like the obvious choice. To my great relief, they have self-checkouts, so I get in line and stare at the floor, trying my hardest not to make eye contact with anyone. After what feels like hours, It's finally my turn. I look up at the screen, and at first glance I thought I was so high, I had somehow forgotten how to read cause I couldn't make any fucking sense of the letters on the screen. Then I realize we're in amsterdam, and everything is in Dutch. This didn't really make things better, I just clicked some shit that looked tasty and somehow managed to pay.

When we get back to the hostel it all just becomes a big blur. I remember lying facedown into my pillow, heart pounding thinking who I should include into my fucking will or some shit, cause I was convinced I was dying. Worth noting is that the clock is like 7pm, so it's not late. I guess I must have fallen asleep cause the next thing I remember is waking up at around 11am, thinking how fucking great it would feel not to be high anymore. But the cakes black magic wasn't done with me yet. It would take another full DAY to wear off, which I can tell you, was anything but pleasant.

TL;DR: Ate spacecakes in Amsterdam, was high for 48 hours straight. Can not recomend.

TIFU by saving a feral kitten on the highway.,"This story began maybe 4 hours ago.

I have always been an animal lover, and have made a habit of helping animals when I can. That's all the backstory you need on me.

I was driving to my boyfriend's house so that we could go and get some delicious ice cream. I was on a highway overpass when I saw a car stopped in the middle of the far lane with its hazard lights on, the driver running around her car trying to catch a kitten that was crouched underneath. It's 7pm so traffic is still fairly heavy, but as an impulse decision I pull in front of her, hit the hazard lights, and go to help . As I ran up to the car, I saw the cat jump up on top of one of the front tires. When I got closer I saw it start to crawl up the wheel shaft until it had its head inside the body of the car, and it started to crawl into what I suppose is the engine area (check my car anatomy). I grabbed onto any fur I could and pulled it back out. When I did this, the cat delivered a solid bite to my finger and gave me some notable scratches. 

The driver lady thanked me profusely but said she was allergic to cats and drove off as soon as she could. I wasn't about to let it loose on the overpass, and my bf's house was only a couple minutes away, so I threw the cat into my hatchback trunk and left. 

I get to the house, look back into the hatchback, and kitty is gone. I look under the seats, pull up the spare tire compartment. Nothing. Houdini kitty. Meanwhile, the bitemarks on my index finger begin pulsing and my hand feels weird. All I wanted was delicious ice cream, and all I could think was that I really didn't want to find a dead kitten somewhere in the guts of my car.

My bf and I search for about 20 minutes before finding the cat wedged inside a speaker panel that I didn't even know existed. You'd have to be about kitten-height to see the hole. Trouble is, we have to dismantle the entire panel and pull it off to get to the cat. So we do just that, pull the cat out, and wrap it in several layers of towel to avoid any more injuries. 

The state of the cat is extremely angry, malnourished and dehydrated. And smells like it eats dead things. If I could guess it's between 3 and 5 months old, and is obviously feral, so no shots. I went to an urgent care and they prescribed me antibiotics, but the doctor told me that someone (myself or animal welfare) has to watch the cat for 10 days to determine if it (or I) has rabies so that animal control can deal with it. By the time all this happened it was too late to call animal control or take it anywhere, so it's in a box with a dish of water and the lightest deli meat I could find. Waiting for the next step. 

Obviously this is not the worst thing that could have happened (I secretly hope I get to keep it) but the whole chain of events seemed worthy of a TIFU.


TL;DR I got bit by a feral demon kitten while trying to save its life and now I have to watch over it and find out if I have rabies.

TIFU by drinking myself to hypothermia,"So this happened a bit ago, but I fell like I need to share the level of stupidity and nobishness that lead to me barely drinking. 

I live in the good ol UK, and for those unaware, the stereotypes of the go hard or go home parties are true to the letter. A relatively popular girl in our college had just turned 18 and was having a huge open door party at a barn, with most of the college being invited. Id agreed to go along with a few friends, as although Im not a massive drinker I like to go out every now and then for a few rounds. I turn up to pre-drinks at said friends house where we proceed to have 3 or 4 rum an cokes before going. As were about to leave we have the bright idea of mixing the remaining half a bottle of rum with the half bottle of coke, so we could keep it going when we arrived. I elected to carry this bottle of poison. 

So we arrive at the barn, a lil later than most other people. We were tipsy but by this point the rest of the party were smashed, with one person already passed out in the blankets provided. The music was non-existent and the conversation was absent, so after a beer I turn to the bottle in my bag. Id oartly forgotten what was in the damn thing at this point so I proceed to drink the whole thing. A half bottle of rum, in under 40 minutes. I hit the floor like a fucking asteroid. I got moved outside to throwup and passed out, where one jackass threw me in a puddle and kicked me in the  head for good measure. I vaguely remember  crawling to a bench and at the rest is just a void.

Que the next morning. I have 30 or so messages from friends that thought I was dead, I was in a bed I didn't recognise and I have a large marching band blaring behind my eyes in walks the friend whos house im at and fills me in. Turns out I got hypothermic from my extended puddle swim. my core temp was getting towards coma levels of low, and paramedics had to be called out to make sure id survive. while this was happening the party had continued and two other people had got to a similar state. Id got alchohol blood poisoning and liver damage. I can no longer drink hard spirits, and I haven't been to a large party since (the public ridicule didn't help)

TLDR-Got bored at a outdoor party and got so drunk I nearly put myself in a hypothermic coma, while everyone else bar 1 exceptionally good friend was too drunk to notice what was going on.

TIFU by bringing a hand grenade to school,"TLDR at the end. Long time lurker, first time poster. Forgive me for any formatting issues, I'm on mobile. After coming across a few stories on this sub the last few days about the wonderful antics of bringing ammunition to school, I figured it was a sign to bring to light my own childhood shenanigans. Obligatory this didnt happen today. 

I don't recall exactly what age I was or what grade I was in at the time of this FU. I do remember that I was in elementary school. Maybe 4th or 5th grade? Who knows! What matters is that I was old enough to know what I brought to school on this fateful day, while still being young enough and stupid enough to commit such a FU. 

Our story begins a few days before show-and-tell day. In the days leading up to show-and-tell, all of my classmates managed to wrangle up much cooler items than I had. I don't recall what, exactly. Action figures, video games, whatever we had in the late 90's that was worth bragging about at that age. 

I was never the coolest kid, still wouldn't consider myself as such. What in the world would I do? I certainly didnt have anything to bring that could stand up to the awesomeness that everybody else was going to bring, and by God, I was *not* going to bring something lame and be made a fool of! **I'M COOL TOO, DAMNIT!!!** ^Ahem, ^sorry. 

So, despite not being very cool myself, I like to think my father is pretty rad. Ex-military. Plenty of stories to go around, as well as quite a few trinkets from his days of service. He's gotta have *something* impressive enough to outdo the rest of the class for show-and-tell, right? Of course! 

By the time I had come to this revelation, it was the day before show-and-tell. With my new inspiration, I eagerly awaited getting home from school that day to see what I could find to take with me the next day. Excited doesn't even begin to describe what I felt at the thought of beating out everybody else at show and tell finally. 

As I arrived back home that afternoon, I took to my mission of finding the best things I could find. Unfortunately for my younger self (But fortunately for my school's sanity/safety and my older self), my father was always pretty serious about gun safety, and kept his gun cabinet locked up tight. Plan foiled, right? As fate would gave it, not at all. Quite the opposite, in fact. 

Of the many mementos my father kept from his time in the service, he hasn't ever really locked up three of them. An old, unused hand grenade (Made inert, of course), a small belt of maybe 10-15 rounds of linked ammunition (Possibly 50 caliber, though I'm not sure) with the ends connected together (Like a bracelet), and one round of an ammunition that I cannot remember the name of to this day (About the size of a 20-30mm apache helicopter round, though I could swear my father said it came from a tank, maybe, or maybe not). 

The next morning, with my newly discovered goodies stuffed in my backpack, and the confidence of defeating my classmates that said goodies brought with them, I made my way to school. With show-and-tell taking place during the last class of the day, the day just could not go by fast enough. But, as most children do, I grew very impatient and just couldn't wait any longer to show everybody the awesome stuff I had brought that day. Alas, my confidence (Or maybe cockiness, now) decided to bite me directly in the ass. 

As we all went to lunch, I came to the conclusion that I absolutely couldn't wait anymore. I had to show everybody how I was going to win show and tell and rub it in their stupid little faces! I proceeded to tell everybody what I had with me. While some thought it was amazing, some didn't believe me. So, naturally, being TIFU, I still hadn't realized the magnitude of what my little idiot brain had done, and decided to prove them wrong. 

**Big mistake.**

For those who don't already know, pulling out a hand grenade and numerous rounds of large ammunition in a crowded elementary school cafeteria is not the greatest of ideas. Do not attempt at home kids. 

My classmates finally believed me, and I was the coolest kid...for all of about 5 minutes. I lucked out in the sense that for a crowded cafeteria, everybody was too wrapped up in their own things to notice my idiocy. I did not, however, escape the consequences of my idiocy entirely. Another student got nervous upon seeing what I had, and went to a teacher, who in turn, went to the principal (Looking back, a pretty relaxed response for a child with a hand grenade). I was promptly called into the office, and got the ass-chewing of a lifetime. Also was on the receiving end of 3 weeks of in-school suspension. My parents, luckily, understood the situation, and while I did get grounded for a bit, no major ass-chewing was received from them. 

Had this taken place after 9/11, I'm sure the outcome would have been significantly different for me, so at least there's that. 

0/10, would not do again. 

**TLDR;** Brought a hand grenade and numerous rounds of ammunition to elementary school for show and tell. Got 3 weeks ISS and a stupid story to tell.

TIFU by bringing bullets to school... and getting caught,"(FYI, this was in fifth grade) Yup, not much to add on to that, my retarded ass brought BULLETS. To a SCHOOL. Let’s do a quick rewind, so you know what got me into that mess in the first place. You need to know 3 very important things about me before we start this story. 

1. My parents were a little too protective for a little too long, so I was a very innocent child until my friends showed me things.
2.  I was an impulsive liar, and a damn good one. This means that if I don’t like the truth, or it’ll be hard to tell, my mind instantly spurts out a lie. This is a very serious problem I still struggle with today (at age 17)
3. I’m also INCREDIBLY self conscious, and in fifth grade, it was so bad that I would hold my breath if I thought I was breathing too loud. 

There’s the recipe for disaster, so here we go: One day I was digging around the house, looking for cool stuff to play with. I went into the basement and found this box of bullets, (a x24 pack of some small rifle caliber) and that was the biggest jackpot EVER. I had been having a pretty horrible week, the weather sucked, I got my blue jeans muddy, and I had been caught/called out for lying by my friends MULTIPLE times(I couldn’t stop). Anyway, in my head, they thought I sucked because they heard me lie about myself doing so many awesome things. I had to redeem myself, and there was no way I was lying about owning bullets not of the nerf variety if I could show them in person. This is the part of my plot where the rational brain should say “HEY FUCKNUTS, DONT TO THAT” but I was super excited, aaaand I didn’t know what a school shooting was. (Thanks Mom and Dad). There was a common sense tick in the back of my mind trying to get me to think, but all I could think about was how cool I would be. 

Fast forward to the next day, I forgot to bring the bullets, but started bragging regardless. And here comes my fatal mistake. I cringe every time I tell this story but... fuck it. Since there was a bunch of bullets, I offered to give some to my school friends, including peer pressuring a kid who I’ll call Bob (Who understood just how bad what I was doing was) into saying he’d take one. Now Bob lives just a few doors down, from me, we were neighborhood buddies, and I’m sure he thought I was spinning another lie (and I don’t blame him). Welp, I called his bluff, and while he didn’t snitch on me 🙏 ,  he was mortified when on the bus the next day I offered him his bullet. But wait, it gets better. 

The way he reacted scared the shit out of me, and while common sense was preparing to ear rape my brain with a megaphone, I hatched another brilliant idea. Brain to self: “Well, he still wants the bullet(he doesn’t), and besides, I’m scared, so let’s drag him into this with us”......... I put the bullet in his desk. 

*sigh* Yeah, I know, take it easy comments. My idiotic 5th grade logic said if he didn’t want it and he got caught we’d face the principal together, and I wouldn’t be so scared or lonely. (I spent a lot of time in the principals office) anyway the worst part is he didn’t even find the damn thing, our SUBSTITUTE TEACHER DID. She nearly popped her top, and I got ratted out instantly. Damnit Bob. 

Well, I felt like horse shit as my common sense was just saying “hey, maybe that was a bad idea”. I got taken out of class and taken to the principal who, fun fact: I had a crush on his daughter that he was well aware of. He gave me a steely glare before I started bawling because I realized what a piece of shit I was and how vain the whole thing was. (Still not knowing the reason the adults were freaking out btw). Well, that made him feel bad too, and he understood I had issues, so he pretty much let it slide, my only punishment being depression and a constant imaginary feeling of judgment from my classmates my self conscious ass got for the next 4 years. I got a worse punishment then he could ever have dished out, and it was self inflicted.

TL;DR I brought bullets to school to show how cool I was, aaaaaand my friends did the right thing by ratting me out and showing what a headass I was.

TIFU I got suspended for punching my the guy that molested my friend,"This happened about a month ago.

So last summer one of my close friends was repeatedly molested by one of her teamates whole they were at a cross country training camp. After the trip we  go to reported it to the school but the guy happens to be the athletic director son so he covers it up and then threatens my friend to kick her off the team for lying and false accusations. So she decides to drop it since she just got a althetic scholarship and doesn't want to lose it.

Fast forward to about a month ago and the end of track season  he approaches her and trys to hug her bye, to which she says stop don't touch  me which he ignores so I straight up punched him and broke his nose. I get called into the office and am told that I'm suspended for punching a student and that I'm losing my spot as captain for both speech and debate and virtual business.

TIFU by spilling the fish sauce,"So this happened about a week ago and it is still haunting me.  For those of you who don’t know fish sauce is basically a fermented fish oil and it smells like hells rotten eggs.  It is commonly used in Thai and other types of Asian cooking.

Now to the fuck up.  I was making muffins and the recipe I was using called for Butter but being a health conscious American I decided that I would use olive oil instead of butter.  The only problem was that I could not find it and in the process of looking for it I was tearing through the top shelf of my pantry where the Fish Sauce was precariously placed.  In my haste I failed to notice that my hand had hit in the exact wrong place and the glass bottle was now on a collision course with my houses hardwood floors.  Well it shattered and released a smell that was a mix between cat pee and vinegar.  Cue 20 minuets of dabbing the floor with pepper towels and spraying febreeze in vain while trying not to gag.  The smell would not dissipate for several days but the liquid was easy to clean up.  The unfortunate thing is that the bottle was made of glass that shattered when it fell to the floor and although I got the big pieces some of the smaller pieces evaded my sight and I ended up with some small glass shards cutting my feet.

TL;DR: I dropped a bottle of fish sauce making my house smell like the devils ball hair and cutting my feet in the clean up effort.

P.S. We are trying to sell our house at the moment so this really can’t help that either.",9,6/14/2018 21:14,tifu,j_sniffles,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8r502p/tifu_by_spilling_the_fish_sauce/,/r/tifu/comments/8r502p/tifu_by_spilling_the_fish_sauce/,8r502p,"To realtor: ""What is that smell, and why is there blood everywhere?

TIFU by sticking a paperclip into an extension cord and forgetting the surge protector was plugged in.,"Basically, I was doing an experiment to see if using a couple of paperclips, binderclips, anti-static wriststrap, and an extension cord to ground myself to something that will absorb the static.

So, I thought to myself “Hey, why not use this spare surge protector as a grounding?” So I pulled out this surge protector, left it unplugged and with the off switch, and set it next to my surge protector by my bed.

[Here is the final contraption. Take note of #4](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/444634459137114125/456994253634273281/image.jpg)

So I grab the cord, and without realizing, accidentally plugged it into my live surge protector.

Remember #4 from the image? Yeah, that’s what I proceeded to do. So, I bent a paperclip into a U and stuck one end in one side, then, the moment of glory, I stuck the other in the other side.

Sparks and an instant withdraw of my hand. My fingers hurt like hell, they were BURNT. I had dropped it onto my bed, so the paperclip’s heat also burnt a hole in my bedsheets.

I ended up avoiding using any surge protectors afterwards, and decided to use my metal bedframe as a ground instead, which is ultimately how I made the contraption.

**TL;DR** Pulled out a surge protector that I left unplugged, set it next to one that WAS plugged, and connected an extension cord into the plugged one without realizing, proceeded to put a paperclip in to see if the surge protector would absorb static discharge and act as a ground. However, I ended up being the ground here.",2,6/15/2018 5:03,tifu,Needs-More-Nuking,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8r8365/tifu_by_sticking_a_paperclip_into_an_extension/,/r/tifu/comments/8r8365/tifu_by_sticking_a_paperclip_into_an_extension/,8r8365,so... stupid... ,CA[deleted],5,37:40.8
"TIFU by using Amazon's ""Buy Now With 1 Click"" feature","The initial fuck up occurred earlier today, but I only discovered it within the last hour.

So, for the past few weeks I've semi\-seriously been seeing this girl that I met on a dating app. Shortly after meeting her, I discovered that she had some pretty submissive kinks. Wanting to surprise her, I planned on ordering a plethora of BDSM\-related toys on Amazon, which I did earlier this morning from my phone. While looking at riding crops, I hit the ""Buy Now With 1 Click"" button rather than the ""Add to Cart"" button once I found one I liked, but quickly hit cancel and thought nothing of it. By default, my Amazon shipping address is my old college apartment (I'm living back at home for the summer), which has different residents in the summer. I went on to add the rest of the desired items to my cart and checked out (these were thankfully shipped to the right address). 

About an hour ago, I checked my email and saw that an item had shipped. ""Great"" I thought, until I opened the email and had my heart drop upon discovering that the toy had been shipped to my old address. I searched furiously for a way to cancel the order to no avail. When I checked out for the summer, I gave a forwarding address for my mail, but have had a few packages sent there (my recurring monthly razors), and haven't had them forwarded to my current address, so I'm not feeling too good about my chances of having this sent to me. I'm banking on the current resident not being a shitlord and opening mail that isn't his/hers.

TLDR: Clicked the wrong button on Amazon's app, had kinky sex toy sent to a complete stranger at my old address.",141,6/14/2018 5:55,tifu,db_95,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8qz5lw/tifu_by_using_amazons_buy_now_with_1_click_feature/,/r/tifu/comments/8qz5lw/tifu_by_using_amazons_buy_now_with_1_click_feature/,8qz5lw,"Well if they do open your mail, I bet it will be the last time.",CA[deleted],109,37:41.3
TIFU by leaving my new cellphone on a treadmill at the gym,"My wife and I recently joined a gym not too far from where we live (its been about 2 weeks since we joined) On Tuesday the 12 June, we were on the treadmill and I left my cellphone on one of those holders on the treadmill, this was at about 17:00. We were working out for about 5 minutes and then left to do other exercises according to our routine – 5 minutes because I dislike cardio as I’m already as thin as a twig. While working out (doing shoulder press to be specific) I realised that I had left my, “5-month-old uninsured, still paying for it on my credit card” Xiaomi Mi6 that I got off Aliexpress on the holder on the treadmill. 

When I went back to fetch it, it was gone. I looked hard and fast in the treadmill section of the gym, also tried tracing my footsteps back to where I had walked prior but nothing. I spoke to the cleaners as well as reception at the gym but no luck. I eventually asked to speak to a manager and the Operations manager took us into his office and we tried calling the phone and it was off. The manager suggested that I hang around and come back afterwards to see if someone will perhaps drop it off after their workout session. I then continued with my workout routine and hit the showers. 

At about 18:45 I left the change rooms and went to reception again and they said that they hadn’t received anything. I then I tried using the ""find my phone"" option on Google as well as on the ""Mi cloud"" option through Xiaomi but to no avail. I also tried “ringing” the cellphone but nothing. My wife and I then stayed at the gym until 21:30 (closing time) to see if anyone perhaps handed in the cellphone. We spoke to the receptionist again and there was nothing. She then called the Operations manager again and he took down my name, details of the cellphone, identity number and alternative number as well as the time we checked in and the time we were using the treadmill. He then said that he needs to lodge an incident and he will get back to me if they find anything. On our way out of the gym, one of the gym staff approach us and said that we should come in the next day and speak to the General manager as he will be able to pull camera footage to see if they can find the culprit that took the cellphone. We thanked him and disheartened we left the gym and went home.

I had work in the morning and my wife works from home so she went to the gym in the morning and spoke to the General manager. She tells me that he was very concerned and said that he will be at the matter and took down all our details from the clothing that we were wearing to the time that we signed in and used the treadmill. He suggested we also go to the police station and report the cellphone missing so that we can get a case number so that when he finds the person that took the cellphone he can call and tell them that if they don’t bring back the cellphone we will be forced to lay a charge against them. The General manager said that he will get back to us latest the Thursday morning (14 June) 

My wife phoned him again this morning to find out if he had found anything. He told her that he only had 45 minutes free from his schedule yesterday and with the footage that he saw, he couldn’t locate us. He also said that the gym camera’s time didn’t correlate to the time that we said we were using the treadmill, so he thinks that the camera’s time is incorrect. He then told her that he will have to go through all the camera footage for that evening and try to locate us and then see who used the treadmill after myself. He said that he will get back to us once he has something – this is where we are at currently.

I spoke to my colleagues yesterday about it as some of them use the same gym and they told me that apparently theft is a problem at that gym, even though it’s quite an upmarket gym (aqua lounges and such) and they suspect it’s the cleaners as people won’t pay an arm and a leg for gym membership fees to take a cellphone that doesn’t belong to them. My wife and I only joined this gym because we are still young and get a “young gym member” discount where we pay almost half of the original price. I Perhaps should mention that I live in South Africa.

I personally haven’t gone back to the gym since the cellphone went missing. My wife says that I shouldn’t blame the gym which I don’t but just the thought of being there creates an unpleasant feeling.

TLDR – Someone “took” my cellphone that I had forgotten in a holder on a treadmill at the gym.",4,6/14/2018 22:33,tifu,defused15,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8r5lz8/tifu_by_leaving_my_new_cellphone_on_a_treadmill/,/r/tifu/comments/8r5lz8/tifu_by_leaving_my_new_cellphone_on_a_treadmill/,8r5lz8,Did you make a police report?

TIFU by almost lighting my whole shed on fire,"This happened last summer, when I was cutting the grass. For some background info, I always had a fascination with fire, I liked to watch things burn, even though I never really tried to light anything on fire. We have a really big garden, around 1000 square meters, so it is kind of boring to cut the grass.  


During one of these sessions of mowing, I got really thristy, which was fine, since I usually take breaks, however, while I was sipping my water and looking at the lawn, the thought came to me: I've never seen gasoline burn IRL. Now, I have made several mistakes here. I poured out some gasoline on concrete, and lit it on fire. Mistake No.1: I poured the gasoline out inside our shed made of wood. Mistake No.2: I put the gas can maybe 3-4 inches far from the pool of gas. Mistake No.3: I didn't put the top on the gas can. Not paying attention to these factors, I light a match, throw it on the fire, a nice poof of flames.  


The evaporating gas from the can caught on fire. I panicked, and I thought to myself ""ok, fire needs fuel, oxygen and heat. Let's take the heat away"". My dumbass started pouring water into the gas can, which, well one fucked up the gasoline, and it didn't really help. I sat there, thinking what should I do, when I started looking for anything to cover the tip of the can up with. But soon, the fire went out by itself, saving my sorry ass.

I poured the gas out immediately, I didn't use it in the mower.

TL;DR: I wanted to see how gasoline burns so I spilled some on the ground in our shed made of wood, put the can without the top next to the puddle and lit it on fire",2,6/14/2018 21:57,tifu,DerpyChop,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8r5c7c/tifu_by_almost_lighting_my_whole_shed_on_fire/,/r/tifu/comments/8r5c7c/tifu_by_almost_lighting_my_whole_shed_on_fire/,8r5c7c,"You should have immediately went and bought a lottery ticket, because if you aren't the luckiest sumbich that that gas can didn't explode and take you out with it, I just don't know who is...",CA[deleted],4,37:43.2
TIFU by trying to buy a game off of Amazon,"So. This happened about 2 hours ago. It all started when my friends started bugging me to buy a multi-player game that they wanted me to play with them (I will leave it unnamed because I do not want to be judged, lol). I wanted to be able to play it tonight and it's too late to leave my house to go to the store and by a digital download code for it, so I tried using Amazon's instant digital download capabilities. So, I made an account and thought I would be smart by using my old prepaid Visa gift cards as currency for my account. 

I tried ordering it and selecting my Visa cards, but I didn't realize I could only have one selected at a time. So I went back and added each card's balance onto my Amazon account directly. It said it would take about 5 minutes to go through, but after 15 minutes, I realized that it wasn't cooperating very well. I did some research and came across an Amazon support page stating that prepaid gift cards and cards with a CVV do not like to work very well for payment. So, I assumed that the cards wouldn't go through and I removed them from my account.

 This is where It started go downhill.

I dug through my cards and found one that had enough balance on it by itself and tried ordering using that, so I wouldn't have to worry about adding the balance on to my account. However, that decided to leave the order pending too, and I assumed that it was because it was also a prepaid gift card. So then, me being the genius that I am, decided that the only way it would work would be to put my debit card on my account and use that. I tried ordering it off of my card and that still wouldn't go through. At this point, I decided to just wait until the morning so I could run to GameStop and by a download code there. 

However, an hour and a half later (about half an hour ago),  I got an email from Amazon saying that the cards went through and that the order was placed, which is a good and bad thing. This meant I had about 60 bucks sitting on my account, and that doesn't help me since I don't order things online ever (hence the reason why I didn't have an Amazon account before this). But alas, I finally had my game and was ready to go into my library and get my digital download code. But when I went to go login, it told me that my account was locked. I went back into my email and noticed another email from Amazon saying that my account was locked due to one of the prepaid gift cards not having billing address and phone number matching what I specified on my Amazon account. The problem is, there is no billing address or phone number attached to that prepaid gift card. So at this point, I am about $90 in the hole and have no way of unlocking my account.

TL;DR:   Tried buying a game off of Amazon, ended up buying it 3 times and got locked out of my account indefinitely, therefore making the game(s) inaccessible.",1,6/15/2018 4:55,tifu,mattattattattatta,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8r81nz/tifu_by_trying_to_buy_a_game_off_of_amazon/,/r/tifu/comments/8r81nz/tifu_by_trying_to_buy_a_game_off_of_amazon/,8r81nz,Call amazon customer service they’re actually very accommodating.

TIFU by burning my hand with piece of hot glass for not thinking,"Mandatory this happen over a year ago at when i was traveling.
so to set the mood it was after i graduated school so i was 19 (i know slow learner ) so me and 2 friends decide to go on a trip to SA , where my friend parents lived, for 2 months , i knew it was a good and horrible idea i mean 3 guys drinking and having fun in another country perfect recipe for disaster.
so fast foward 1 month we are in the middle of the trip and my friend brother was having his birthday so we thought it was a good reason to drink like animals and it was all good  you know everyone is happy drinks are free and it's a good time till i felt like i was seeing people where moving like the flash very blurry and i knew i could handle my alcohol ( im not from the US so i been drinking since i was 16) but at this point it was the point of no return and people keep passing me alcohol like there was no tomorrow so after some shots i decide i need a smoke break but with all the moving and dancing i had lost my lighter and i couldn't reconize anyone that had a lighter so i saw a fire in front of me and decide that should sufice to light my smoke so i go reach and the fire to pick it up but there was a  protective glass that keep it from going off and not burning people , but the drunk me tought that the glass was just for making it look pretty so i went and lift the glass of the fire to light my smoke , about 2 seconds after i do that i felt a pain like never before and i realize this lamp is hot very HOT it was burning all day and night and i just grab it (lamp https://imgur.com/uI7adXz) as i felt the pain my drunk mind stop for a minute trying to figure out what should i do whit the hot glass my mind felt like i was being tourture for info what should i do with this glass should i drop it and let it break no people where walking bare foot it will be bad , change hands ? stupid idea it will burn my other had, pass it ...  i held it for like it felt like an  eternity before realizing i could just put it back on the table , i spend the rest of the night siting in a corner with my hand inside a cool box fill with ice to wake up the next morning hungover with blister on all my right hand and my friends mocking me ...

TIFU By Opening My Stitches After Surgery and Bleeding a Lot...,"So this happened a few days ago, I had just gotten surgery to remove some tissue in my breasts (genetic stuff) or something. Eventually after a few days, my right breast had healed fine and the scar vanished. My left breast was a whole different ballgame. They had to take out more on my left breast so it was all swollen and purple with bruising. The swelling didnt go down for a week, so me being bored, i made plans with friends. My friend was hosting a bonfire, so I showed up, it was a pretty fun night (aside from my friends calling me “purple titty”) but towards the end of the night is where the fuck up begins. For whatever reason, my friend puts a pillow down on the driveway to “stare at the stars”. 
You don’t even fucking see stars because it’s so polluted. So I decided to lie down too, but directly face down, chest towards the ground. I fell hard on accident and my stitches directly collided with the pavement and I was met with intense pain. It subsides and I go home thinking nothing of it. Fast forward later that night. I’m at home, minding my own business, and I look down and see my wound GUSHING blood. I run and tell my grandma, and my grandma is panicking thinking i’m gonna die, and im panicking because I saw blood. She patches me up and we think nothing of it. Few days later and i’m in bed at 6 am bc bad sleeping schedule, and I feel something wet. Thinking it’s my own spit or something, i  ignore it, but look at my wound and of course, it’s just a big red dot, through the bandage. I go and tell my mother, and she takes off the bandage and low and behold, a massive fucking bloodstain, and the stitches are gone, as I gush massive blood. We wrap it up, and I had to wash my sheets incase of blood and I got no sleep that night.

Im going to doctor now to get it sorted.

TIFU by losing an entire warehouse's ability to listen to music.,"So this happened yesterday, but the fallout of my dumb move went into effect today. I work for a very well known logistics company and we are contracted with a very well known medical company. Typically the uppers don't mind if we have music playing in certain sections of the warehouse (I work in receiving) so they usually don't say much other than ""keep it down"" and ""keep it work appropriate."" Now, our ability to play music hasn't always been around. We've had some shit management really suppress even the idea of music because it can be ""distracting."" In reality, music has proven to help even the most minuscule of tasks around my job, and it improves everyone's moods dramatically. The new management realized this and made it okay at the beginning of this year (I've been with the company for 3.5 years). So, how can one fuck this up?

It had been a rough morning to say the least so I wasn't really in a Bob Marley mood. I was trying to play music off one website but was running into trouble so I picked another. Without name dropping the sites so this post doesn't get flagged for advertising, the runner up website was working just fine. The task was at hand, and I began breaking down pallets (moving a bunch of boxes from one pallet to another) like a madman because Black Sabbath was playing loud and proud. On this particular day the company that my job is contracted with (our customer) was giving a tour to several corporate heads from other medical companies (future partners) to show how the place is run. We had run out of pallets so it was my job to hop on the forklift to go grab a new stack. Upon my return I drop off the new stack and park the forklift. As I get off I look up to see my GM and our customers site director making a b\-line for me. I figured it was going to be the usual ""how are things going down here"" chit chat....boy was I wrong....

The conversation goes a little bit like:

GM: ""Well?""

Me (channeling my best Morgan Freeman from Shawshank Redemption): ""Well what?""

Site Director: ""You mind explaining just what in the hell you are listening to!?""

Me: ""Uhhh...OH! Black Sabbath!"" (with a shit eating grin on my face).

GM (die hard Sabbath fan, has seen them 4 times): ""Nope, definitely wasn't sabbath.""

Frantically I run to my computer and check with both of these gentlemen in tow. As I look on the history of what was played, what do I see? A song....but a song called ""YOUR MOTHER SUCKS COCK IN HELL"" by a band I had never heard before. I have no idea how or why this song came on the playlist I had been listening to for almost an hour, but ho lee shit did I turn blood red after finding out who heard it. In my absence to get a new stack of pallets, the much anticipated tour came swinging through my section of warehouse just as the above song began its lovely lyrical work. I was later pulled into my GM's office with my Supervisor and Lead and we had a lengthy discussion with a few of our customers head honchos (site director included). After many ""it wont happen again's"", and ""you're absolutely right's"", I slowly trudged back to my section of warehouse. I could feel the weight of embarrassment slowly begin to crush my soul, and I just kept to myself the rest of the day.

In this mornings huddle before the daily duties begin, my GM and our customers site directer announce that music is now forbidden until further notice. So I stood there with my arms crossed and head held high because I thought ""There's no way anyone knows it was because of me hahaha right.....riiiiiight?.....RIGHT!?."" Wrong! Word had spread like wildfire, and now I have a staff of about 45\-60 people giving me the death stare at 7 AM. Today was one of the longest shifts I have ever had, and no one spoke to me except the couple of guys I work with every day reminding me how bad I fucked up. 

TL;DR by unknowingly playing some awful music I never even heard before around corporate heads and pissing off all management and workers alike. Now in the doghouse until further notice.

TIFU by flossing too hard and creating a hole where my gum used to be.,"This was only a couple years ago, I had braces on and I remember the dentist telling me I needed to floss. So I got floss sticks, and I proceeded to floss my teeth with them, vigorously, every day, I really put a lot into it thinking I was doing my teeth a lot of good, until I created a whole in the middle of my teeth where my gum used to be. The thing is, I didn’t even realise what I was doing or that I created it. So I kept doing it all the time drilling my teeth with this pink floss, RIP my gum, it will be missed. Well I guess I can live with it but it’s not the best and I sometimes I am self conscious about it. I also have a stain on my tooth which is quite small but I guess people can see it when I smile, it was masked by my gum but now it’s on show.I now floss a lot more carefully and always go quite slow when I floss. So yeah that’s about it, has anyone else done something like this before and done something bad to their teeth, or anything on your body that makes me feel a little better?

TIFU by forgetting my passport while traveling to Canada,"Holy shit, this story has a happy ending but goddamn this was nuts. So I’m going to Canada from Boston on an overnight bus and decided to pack last night so I could go home after work pick up my shit and leave. Now I have a history of cutting it mad close when I travel, a terrible habit but I’ve on multiple occasions arrived at airport terminals as they’re boarding the last passengers, or just about to shut gates, etc. Anyways, this time I left home for the bus terminal a little bit early actually bc I figured I’d be early this time, get some food and sit at the terminal you know maybe get a good seat on the bus. So my bus is at 11:50pm, I get to the bus terminal 10:55pm, get food from a restaurant and 11:03pm, I’m walking to the terminal. Then it hits me like a 16 wheeler truck, I totally fucking forgot my goddamn passport!!! 


It was fight or flight mode now, my mind raced for options, Uber, Lyft, miss the bus and sleep at terminal, then I ran outside and saw a row of taxis, I went up to the one that looked the fastest and said “I need you to do exactly what I say, we have 45 mins to get from here to Brighton and back” and it was on. The silver lining is I work on an ambulance so I know the roads better than most and handle stress very well, plus the taxi driver was experienced and willing to speed. I lead him to the turnpike, and goddamn there is now road construction, there fucking wasn’t construction when I was coming to the station, I’m on edge but still determined to make it. Every turn, every traffic light was crucial to time precisely. Boston is very unforgiving in terms of directions, if you’re in the wrong lane even half a mile away you could get screwed, so I told him exactly which lane to go and which back roads got us there quicker, he had a decent mental map of Boston as well. We got to my place 11:27pm I sprinted up stairs got the passport, and was back in the taxis at 11:30pm. We go to the turnpike again and now there is fucking construction on the other side too, I’m grinding my teeth and thinking what is the most efficient way to pay this man so I can run straight from the taxi. We pull to the terminal 11:45pm, I pay him handsomely, and I ran up several sets of stairs and just barely make it on the bus. 


Man if I’d remembered that I forgot it but was at the border, I would’ve been screwed and it that would’ve been a nightmare. If I took an extra 5 mins in the shower, if I did literally anything different in my routine before leaving the first time I would’ve missed the bus. If my Uber pool coming in the first time picked up anyone else. If I got an Uber back to Brighton and they were following a gps I would’ve been screwed. Lesson learned, make a check list, check it twice. My fries are now cold. 

TL;DR forgot my passport at the bus terminal, got a hero taxi driver to Hail Mary show me the meaning of haste back, barely made it for the bus",6,6/15/2018 5:53,tifu,aerilink,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8r8cwf/tifu_by_forgetting_my_passport_while_traveling_to/,/r/tifu/comments/8r8cwf/tifu_by_forgetting_my_passport_while_traveling_to/,8r8cwf,CB[deleted],CA[deleted],CS[deleted],53:12.4

During that time, she decided that I was going to be safer ""with the angels"" than with all the demons (some of these were straight up delusions and others were fueled by pure paranoia). So, she took me into the bathroom, filled up the tub and nearly succeeded in drowning me. Would have succeeded had the man she was shacked up with at the time not walked in at the right moment, dragged her off of me, and started to administer CPR until the EMTs arrived. 

Thankfully, this incident finally allowed the courts to pull their heads out of their asses and remove me from her custody and have her declared as an unfit parent. This could have likely been prevented had they figured that considering she was declared unfit *twice* when in custody battles involving both my younger siblings the court would have been like, ""hm if she is unfit for them maybe she is unfit to care for her eldest."" But alas, this was 24 years ago when the court system was even worse than it is today about this kind of thing. 

The only lasting damage I really had from this event was that for the majority of my childhood and into my late teens I had a deep phobia of bathtubs. When I was younger I was so terrified of them I would have panic attacks if I even had to use the toilet in a bathroom that had a tub in it. That level dropped as I got older into a extreme dislike and aversion to them but at least I didn't have panic attacks unless I tried to use them. I eventually did get over it.

TIFU by summoning a Kenyan drug lord on a school trip,"Yes Reddit. Its here. For those just joining us, I must again apologise for this took place some time ago.

In my second last year of secondary school I was fortunate enough to participate in a volunteer program in East Africa over my summer holidays. The idea was we'd spend a month constructing new classrooms for a struggling school on the coast of Kenya, south of Mombasa and then work in a safari park (Shimba Hills IIRC) before crossing over to Tanzania for an actual safari in Ngorongoro Crater and then top it off with an ascent of Mt Kilimanjaro. This wasn't free by the way, I had signed up for it a year before and had participated in loads of fund raising events to make it happen.

We had two teachers accompany us on the trip, Mr F who was a no nonsense former Royal Marine Commando as well as Mr B who was an absolute legend. Mr F's girlfriend also joined us, she wasn't a teacher but she had first aid qualifications. 

Mr F utterly despised me and my friends who were, embarrassingly, the sk8r/st0ner contingent of the school, with long hair, band t's, the works. To him we were useless pinheads and he sent us on all the worst jobs on the construction site. Mr B was more interested in ordering in crates of Kilimanjaro beer and trading albums with me (AFI - Sing the Sorrow for NOFX - So Long and Thanks For All The Shoes was probably my favourite swap). I wont digress too much but giving a band of Masai Mara warriors my CD player later in the trip and watching them do their leaping dances to NOFX was awesome.

During our free time we had befriended the local villagers who enjoyed inviting us to their homes for food and trying to sell us trinkets, cigarettes and awful tasting home-brewed coconut wine. Eventually the most charismatic villager, a fisherman named Sayid stepped up to the plate and offered us some weed. We bought a stick off him for about $5 down in the mangroves thinking we'd smoke it later when the teachers were asleep but he insisted on rolling it up, pure, into a single huge spliff and we hopped in his little boat and he took us on a tour of the mangrove swamp.

""You like?"" He said.
""Yeh its not bad, at home we smoke hash though, do you get it in Kenya too?"" I replied. Remember this part, as everything that happened later is contingent on this verbal exchange.

During the boat ride I wasn't feeling much, but then it suddenly hit me as we went back to shore: pure brain melt, watery bloodshot eyes, insane paranoia. Then the bell rang summoning us back to the camp. I was not ready. We tried to join up with the rest of the group as inconspicuous as possible, but likely looking as conspicuous as hell. Over the course of lunch Mr F kept on giving us weird looks, feeding my paranoia even more. Eventually his GF came up to us and said something like ""Boys, your eyes look a bit funny, what have you been up to?"" Cold sweats.
""Its just hay-fever miss, the villagers took us in the long grass and the pollen got me really bad"".
""It doesn't look like that too me, I better not see you like this again or you'll be sent home"".

About half an hour later, two unexpectedly looking nice cars came down the dirt track leading to our camp. I didn't give them much heed but they pulled up to the gate and about 5 or 6 of the scariest looking dudes got out. 

""[My name], can you come to the gate, some people want to speak to you"" someone said, I don't remember who. 

As I was still high I started to panic again and the paranoia was back. I walked over to them. I'm not sure how the conversation went, but the scope of this most colossal fuck up dawned on me. Sayid had totally misunderstood me with his broken English. He had thought that I was asking to send hash back home and this was his lucky day and he could act as broker for a deal that would set him up for life, likely calling someone who called someone else and so on until the news had reached some senior guy from Mombasa who had come down to the camp to strike a deal. And listen Reddit, before you jump on me and call me an idiot and tell me not to travel, lets think about this first. In no way is this a reasonable outcome for the conversation I just had. Yeh fine, smoking on a school trip is never a good idea, but I was in the army cadets for 4 years and every trip turned into a smoke up after dark without incident.

I think I managed to mumble some sort of feeble excuse like ""I'm sorry I have to go"". Then I ran and hid in the toilets and locked the door.

About a minute later I heard Mr F yell my name.

""Where the fuck are you, you filthy little druggie""
""Where is he boys?""
""Hes in the toilet sir""
Silence, then Mr F's huge tree trunk arms pounding on the door.
""You fucking little shit, what have you done? Who are these people? Come out here now""

""I can't sir.... I'm on the toilet, its really bad"" This was sadly the best thing I could think of.
""Get the fuck out here now""
""I can't sir, its diarrhoea, really bad""
""You fucking little liar, open this door""

He was trying to shake it off its hinges. I wanted to die, I wanted the ground to open up and swallow me, I was going to get expelled, my parents were going to kill me, my life was effectively over.

At this point Mr F's girlfriend and Mr B stepped in, urging him to calm down.

""Let us talk to him"". 
""What happened, why are these people here""
""I'm so sorry, I was just talking about weed and he must of got the wrong idea, I have no idea how this could of happened.""

Somehow it was smoothed over, I don't know how, but I stayed in that toilet for hours, fearing shame, mockery and punishment when eventually that door was opened. When I came out the dealers from Mombassa were gone. The teachers had searched all my stuff and found nothing which had further supported my defence. 

The rest of the trip passed without incident. I wasn't expelled, my parents weren't called, Mr F was even nice to me after a few days, probably embarrassed about totally flipping out. Sure there were a few jokes but it was just too surreal to continually feel bad about. Also I think Mr B and Miss F had done me a huge favour by calming Mr F, coming to my defence and for that I am forever grateful.

TL;DR a simple misunderstanding during a conversation with an enterprising Kenyan fisherman resulted in gangsters driving down from Mombassa to arrange terms with me for a hash smuggling operation back to the UK, temporarily making a teacher go berserk at me.

Edit 1: Thank you again for all the feedback. It’s been great having this interaction as it’s been a lonely time on my road trip these last few weeks.

I’ll try and post my Indian mishap on Sunday and round off the trilogy. 

On a final note before I go to bed: Travel has really helped me with some serious issues in my life such as depression, anxiety and low self esteem. I’d like to create an elitism free space to help and encourage others to give it a go and share experiences, both positive and calamitous. If anyone knows of a suitable medium please message me (I’m not particularly tech savvy FYI).  

Edit 2: I should of elaborated on this more but the library was closing and I was trying to hammer out the events as fast as possible on a proper keyboard. They were driving clean BMWs (or similar) in an area where most people didn’t even have a car, same goes for their clothing.

There was also obviously a head guy amongst them and he has a fair bit of jewelry on. Whatever he said to 16 year old me cemented the idea that he was a big deal in my head but I just can’t recall what.

TIFU by breaking my neck and not noticing it for three days,"This story actually took place last April, but I thought I'd share nonetheless, because to this day this must be the *dumbest* thing I've ever done in my life.

It was my sophomore year in college. A buddy of mine (let's call him Josh, for storytelling sake) was going to spend a weekend on a beach in Port Aransas, Texas, and said he had two vacant spots for whoever wants to tag along. His parents were paying for the trip and wanted some company to come with, so they told him to invite some of his friends. At the time I haven't seen sea in over two years and really missed it (I used to swim a lot back in the days), and also figured it would be a great way to spend a weekend considering everything was paid for, so naturally I jumped right in.

We arrived at our hotel on Friday night at about 8pm: me, Josh, our mutual friend who we shall call Kyle, and Josh's parents. Immediately after unpacking the three of us left for the beach, which was roughly 2 minutes away, while Josh's parents decided to go for a ride. It was already getting dark and frankly it was a bit chilly. Kyle and Josh were staying right at the shore, too hesitant to get into the water, so I decided I'd go in first and they would have no choice but to follow my example.

So I ran in, splashing water all around me, and when I was about waist-deep, I decided to go for a dive and see how far I can swim underwater. And here's where my overconfidence and lack of practice got the best of me: I dove head-first right into a sandbank, completely unaware of it being there. I hit it so hard I could hear ringing in my ears, and when I got up I almost fell over. Being so embarrassed about it, I tried to act like everything was fine, and my friends didn't seem to notice anything was adrift. A few minutes later I felt considerably better and almost forgot about this incident. I realized my head was bleeding a bit, but I shrugged it off: it shouldn't have been surprising after a hit this hard. I genuinely thought I got away with just a scratch. Boy was I wrong!

Next day I still felt a bit dizzy and felt some discomfort in the neck, so I suspected I might have also had a mild concussion and maybe a whiplash. However, I didn't want to ruin the trip for anyone, and also didn't want to go bankrupt so I decided I wouldn't mention it to anybody and wouldn't go to a doctor. Bad, bad mistake. Always check in with a doctor if you suspect something is off! [However, at that time I didn't think so.](https://pics.me.me/i-am-not-a-clever-man-19336295.png)

[Three days have passed](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/spongebob/images/5/51/Dayfour.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130714195327). We had a lot of fun hanging out on the beach, visited SandFest, came back home and went back to classes. The slight discomfort in my neck wouldn't go away, but I was certain it was simply a whiplash and thought it would go away on its own. However, as the time passed, I was more and more inclined on checking with a doctor just in case.

Finally, on Tuesday morning I didn't feel like going to class, so I decided to go to a clinic and get myself checked out. The doctors immediately put a [comfortable neck brace ](https://i.imgflip.com/2cahv8.jpg)on me and took an CAT scan, and some mere 15 minutes later the surgeon came in and announced I had a neck fracture and possibly a mild concussion. He asked why I didn't call an ambulance. I said I didn't think it was serious and that it happened over three days ago. Confused, he left to order a better brace for me. Left to my own devices, I realized I might be late for my next class, so I emailed my teacher something along these lines:

""I'm currently in a hospital, nothing serious, just a broken neck and a light concussion, may be late for class""

[How she must've imagined me after reading that](https://i.imgur.com/c4jt321.png)

However, I was immediately sent home and forbidden from going anywhere for at least a week, and especially from driving. As the surgeon said, ""Any driving accident at this point is guaranteed to kill you until you heal"", so I was grounded. At the same time, the rumors about a Russian guy who broke his neck and walked around like that for days spread rapidly among the students in my university, and I was overwhelmed with messages from people I've never even met before. The teacher I sent my short email to was only adding fuel to the fire by telling about it to every class she had, emphasizing the part where I called a neck fracture and a concussion ""nothing serious"". By the time I got back, I was already something of a local celebrity: everybody knew about me and everybody wanted to talk to me ~~or take a piece of me for a talisman~~ or make some sort of a remark. I ended up wearing the brace for two and a half months, and luckily didn't have any long-term consequences.

TL;DR: Broke my neck while diving, didn't think it was anything serious for over three days until visited a doctor, became really popular because of that",111,6/15/2018 18:03,tifu,AltSk0P,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8rcjux/tifu_by_breaking_my_neck_and_not_noticing_it_for/,/r/tifu/comments/8rcjux/tifu_by_breaking_my_neck_and_not_noticing_it_for/,8rcjux,I'm happy there were no long term problems.

TIFU by being an idiot with my school schedule,"My apologies as this happened many years ago. I tried recalling as many details as possible. 

Here we go:

I was in high school and whenever the next semester was coming up we would have assistance with signing up for the following semester classes. Typically this was done with paper, and a teachers assistance.

One year, the school decided we could just do it online and they would give us a sheet of paper with what we needed course wise. This was the first year that it was more ""hands on"".

I decided that I wanted to take all honors classes. In the past you had to have a prior teacher sign off for honors. Since I was applying online, I saw an opportunity to skip around those rules. I saw the normal classes and saw an exact replica of said classes with two little letters in front of it (SE). I selected all of the classes that said SE, and logged out. I didn't think about it again until the next semester.

Next semester I get my schedule and (surprise) all of my classes had (SE) next to it. I was excited to be in honors and told my family. When I compared my schedule with my friends I noticed we didn't have any classes together. My high school was relatively small, so I thought it was a little odd but I didn't look into it much further. 

When the bell rang and I arrived at my first class, they had the door open and 3 teachers were in the room. When I walked in they all greeted me and were really nice. They already had a seat for me with my name on it. When I sat down, I noticed only a handful of kids were in the class with me. What a small class, and so many teachers. 

When the bell rang they shut the doors and locked it. When I looked around at my fellow classmates is when I realized something was wrong. I didn't know any of the kids. One was drooling on his desk next to me and seemed to have a hard time keeping his head up. Another person that stands out is a girl who was tapping on her desk really loud and just seemed very angry and off. The more I looked, the more I realized that this wasn't honors class. I was surrounded by people with different disabilities and issues.

I raised my hand and asked what class we were in. The teacher talking ignored me and kept on talking. I grabbed my schedule and when I looked at it I realized my mistake. SE was not a honors class. It was for Special Ed. I had signed up for special ed classes for people with disabilities.

I stood up and tried explaining I had made a mistake. The teachers refused to let me leave and thought I was having an outburst. One of the teachers sat next to me and whispered it was ok, and to calm down. She said the first day of class was always a little nerve wracking and I would make friends. No one was listening to what I was trying to explain. I endured the whole class.

When the bell rang I figured I would go to the office and explain my situation to them. The problem, the next class you had a escort.  Some people stayed in the room and 2 other kids came with me and another teacher. At this point I loudly exclaimed that I made a mistake with my schedule and I was going to the office. 

I didn't wait for the teacher to reprimand me, and left. I was followed to the office by a teacher and once I was in the office they tried guiding me out. I legitimately think they thought I was throwing a fit. In a way, I kind of was. My assistant principal saw me in distress and told them she would have a talk with me.

When I went into her office, I explained my situation. When I showed her my schedule and told her I thought I had signed up for honors classes and instead it was special ed classes she lost it. She laughed for a good 5 minutes and told me that technically it could take 3 days to change schedules, and that she should leave me in it for good measure. 

She ended up changing my schedule, and called the SE classroom to explain the issue. I was placed in normal classes and honestly after what I did, I don't blame her. I never brought up honors again. I had several siblings that had attended before me, so she knew my family. When she called my mom and explained the situation they laughed for another 10 minutes.

None of my family, or friends ever let me live it down. That was the last year they let us do our schedule change online. It was never said, but I think I might of contributed to that. Until the day I graduated my assistant principal always had a small smile on her face and a twinkle in her eye when I saw her. 

TL;DR- I thought I could skip the rules set in place and apply for honors classes the easy way. INSTEAD, I signed up for special ed classes. 

Please forgive spelling mistakes. 

Note- By me telling what happened I am not degrading anyone who have disabilities. It was just a honest mistake and misunderstanding that happened to deal with special ed classes.",58,6/15/2018 14:54,tifu,Beep_bop_milk,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8rb3xd/tifu_by_being_an_idiot_with_my_school_schedule/,/r/tifu/comments/8rb3xd/tifu_by_being_an_idiot_with_my_school_schedule/,8rb3xd,What did you think SE stood for? ,CA[deleted],12,01:18.5
"TIFU by burning my mouth with a microwaved firecracker, also known as a hardboiled egg.","Made hardboiled eggs today.

TIFU by leaving my porch light on in June in AL,"I can admit that really I FU every day just by living in this godawful state, but that’s beside the point. I opened my back door to let my 2 dogs out into the fenced yard. I closed the door and then thought, hey, I’ll turn the outside light on for them cuz I’m a nice lady. Big mistake. 

I come back a few minutes later and open the door to let the pups in. That’s not what comes in. Summer in Alabama is hot and buggy. Junebugs are a real thing. Gross little beetles. Well the Junebugs were attracted to the light. When I opened the door, they all flew in. 11 of them. It was a nightmare. 

I started screaming and trying to swat them back out the door, but more kept coming in. I’m grabbing them with my bare hands now and tossing them out. My husband is playing Fortnite so naturally he can’t help. It takes me about 10 minutes to finally get the majority of them out and the dogs back in. 

Then I spent another few minutes finding the three that had gotten farther into the house. 

Moral of the story: Don’t leave your porch light on, bugs love it. Or don’t live in the south U.S. 

TL;DR: Porch light on, Junebugs fly in, panic and terror ensues.

TIFU by watching Brokeback Mountain,"Sorry for formatting and stuff as I'm on mobile!

So this happened 2-3 years ago but it just popped up in my mind. I was having summer break and went to Bosnia to visit my family as always.

My uncle called me one day over to help him set up a new TV which he bought (including a DVD player, sound bar and so on). After I finished everything he told his son and me to go to the store and buy some DVDs so we can watch them.

When we arrived I saw a shelf with oscar awarded films. When i saw Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal I immediately thought this is going to be a very good cowboy movie. I didn't check the back for details or what the plot was about. My cousin didn't really care and paid for it.

We drove home and I find my grandmother uncle aunt almost everybody is there. After having dinner I put the DVD in and it started to play. Oooh boy how I f*cked up. The scene started to play where they start to kiss, undress etc. My whole family looked at me and thought I was gay (they are very religious people). Everybodys began shouting at me ""Are you watching this at home when you are alone"", ""You are sick, seek a cure from god"", ""Turn this shit off, I'm going to puke"" and many other insults.

After a loooong silence they tell me to go home. The next day I find my uncle and a priest at my door to ""cure me from my homosexuality"". The priest told me all kind of stuff, said I was possessed by a demon. This went on for a week before he said that I was finally cured.

Now to the TIFU part, my house is in a village no more than 200 people so everybody knows everybody. I don't know how but every single person knew that I watched this. There was even a rumor that I have a boyfriend. Everywhere I went I was declined service. From getting a haircut to buying groceries. I had to drive to the city if I wanted anything. No one wanted to speak with me not even my family (except my parents but they were in a different country). To this day I'm still getting looked at in disgust.

TIFU by using a dog poop bag wrong (for 2 months).,"In fact, this has been a fuck up for the last 2 months I've had my puppy. When I got my puppy, the adoption agency gave me a roll of bags and told me they're used for the dogs poop, but never actually showed me how to use it. Adding that to the fact that I'm a brand new pet owner, for the last 2 months, I thought I was supposed to hold the bag open underneath her butt because that was the only way that made sense to me. Whenever she'd get in her squat position, I'd run over to then get on my knees waiting for the deuce to drop. Of course, I wasn't perfect and would get some smeared on my hands, but I thought that was normal and would just not touch anything wash my hands when I got back home. I'm suddenly feeling the cringe that comes from all the people who've walked by seeing me do that. It wasn't until today that my brand new neighbor (I just recently moved apartments) who is also a dog owner showed me the correct way to do it. If I was white, I probably would've turned red at that moment from embarrassment. And now I'll have to live next to the woman who saw me hold a bag underneath my dog's anus to catch her poop. Plus, who knows what else I'm doing wrong.

TIFU by trying to get on an exercise bike,"Where I work, we have a lot of gym equipment. Treadmill, weight rack, bowflex, and a couple excercise bikes; one stationary bicycle, and one Schwinn Air-Dyne. One day, I decided to start using the Air-Dyne to try and burn off some pounds. Well, just a few minutes ago, I tried mounting the thing, stepping on one of the pedals instead of using the foot pegs as is proper. 

Predictably, I lost my balance and the pedal flipped over. As a result, I fell a few inches and one of the handlebars punched me in the rib. 

While I’m standing there, groaning, feeling my ribcage to make sure I didn’t break anything after my insides were jostled by the fierce impact, I let out a long, low fart. Right at the end, this fart became a shart. It was a long, embarrassing waddle to the nearest toilet to check my underpants to make sure they weren’t ruined. Luckily, there was no one around to witness any of this. 

TL;DR - Slipped off an exercise bike, hit my ribs and shit my drawers.",16,6/15/2018 16:57,tifu,THASF,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8rc1fl/tifu_by_trying_to_get_on_an_exercise_bike/,/r/tifu/comments/8rc1fl/tifu_by_trying_to_get_on_an_exercise_bike/,8rc1fl,CB[deleted],CA[deleted],CS[deleted],01:27.9
TIFU by smashing and drowning a friends Iphone 8,"Happened just yesterday at school. We had muck-up / free dress day ( which means you don't have to wear uniform for you 'Murican peeps) so everyone was in a pretty bright mood, me and this friend a bit too happy maybe. We were all standing near a tiny storm drain together and we're just generally goofing around. Now this girl who's phone I broke was getting a little to edgy with her jokes (like calling out to my ex and saying I wanted to lift her skirt etc) so just as a joke a flicked my jumper in her face, she freaks, catches the jumper and smacks her phone out of her hand. It smashes against the concrete and tumbles into the drain. I panic and pull it out quickly (it hasn't rained lately so it's only like 5 cm deep) and the entire group loses its shit laughing. Turns out the main speaker is not working and it has general water damage, plus cracks on the screen etc... She was really cool about it saying that its fine and I don't have to pay her back etc but goddamn if my friends are ever going to let me forget this...

TIFU by forgetting my boss's boss's bosses at the airport,"TL;DR I left 4 very important execs at the airport due to my own greed and it cost me $$$$$$.   

Not today, but a few years ago right after I graduated college.

My first job was as an analyst at corporate for a global auto manufacturer in the luxury cars sales operations department. As part of my job, I managed a fleet of brand new luxury vehicles, both for executives and for VIPs. It was a real pain because I had to arrange maintenance, keep them clean, etc. Plus side, whenever they weren't being used, I got to drive them. Cool perk for a new grad.

So anyway, I flew home to visit my newly minted fiancee. We'd been long distance cross-country for about 6 months at this point and I foresaw the rest of our engagement being long distance due to an upcoming job relocation.

At the airport, Delta was calling for volunteers. Eventually, the voucher ramped up to $800 and I couldn't resist. These cross-country plane tickets were bleeding me dry. The only catch was my new flight would be the next morning. No worries, I let my team know that I had been ""booted"" from my flight because it was oversold. Here's where the TIFU begins. 

What I forgot about was that several executives had requested a fleet car and a pickup from LAX for a national bigwig meeting the next morning. These 4 executives collectively managed the sales operations and thereby car dealerships of quite literally half of the US sales operations for this luxury car brand. 

As soon as I landed in LAX, I had dozens of calls, texts, and emails from one of the execs. What started as ""Hey, we landed"" turned into ""Where the hell are you?"" This guy was actually the person who hired me into the company before he'd been promoted. 

Oh. Shit. 

I called a coworker panicking and had him pick me up while I tried to arrange new accommodations and fix my fuck up. (At the time, LAX wasn't allowing Uber pickups.) What I didn’t know was these execs were standing in the pickup line and saw me get picked up. They took a taxi. 

While riding back to HQ, I called my boss. He shared my ""oh shit"" sentiments. But matters were worse. Turns out that the SUV I had arranged to place these 4 execs in hadn't been returned yet. And it was still being held by another exec from international headquarters in Japan. This Japanese exec was essentially more important than all of the other guys. So I very politely emailed him asking if I could get the keys from him. He was a nice guy and just said ""oh, sorry! I forgot to return them. I'll put them on your desk."" 

I get back to the office and sprint into the building to get these keys and check out the state of the returned vehicle. Meanwhile, the 4 execs arrive in their taxi...right behind me. Of course I don't notice them. Unfortunately for me, the returned SUV was very dirty. I tried offering a sedan to the execs, but they said ""no, it's too small."" So I had to go and hand wash and vacuum this SUV while these 4 execs waited. 

I delivered the keys to a set of very displeased men and women. They ended up being about an hour late to this national meeting. Guess who got thrown under the bus (and quite loudly)? Ya boi. Later, I asked my company mentor what to do about the situation. He said, ""Don't worry about it. Everyone new at the company makes these kind of mistakes. Confronting the problem will only make a mountain out of a molehill."" Worst advice ever.

This fuck up cost me three different promotions. Instead of getting relocated back to the office in my home state or one of the offices I was interested in, I got placed at (arguably) the worst of the regional offices in New England. By the time I left the company, people hired in the same ""development program class"" were 2 promotions ahead of me making 40&#37; more than me.

I don't work there anymore.

"TIFU by acting like an off brand ninja commando in Iraq. Also, an idiot.","TIFU by trying to be a stealthy ninja commando motherfucker. Now this actually happened over a decade ago, but it definitely qualifies. It's a long one, so buckle the fuck up.


The setting? Mosul, Iraq. This was back before it was blown all to hell and gone, but also slightly after it was blown all to hell and gone. That city has seen some shit, is what I'm saying.


I was a young Specialist in the US Army Infantry, pretty goddamn stupid if we're being honest, but at least I kinda knew it by this point in my life. There's a place in Mosul that used to broadcast pro American propaganda, a certain TV station that we used to work out of. We'd patrol from there, kick in doors from there, and watch the fireworks that generally occurred in downtown Mosul. That place was rockin’ like a nickel night whorehouse back then. 

What wasn't so rockin' was staying in the middle of the city for a week at a time. The food sucked. It was either MREs or ramen noodles. There wasn't shit to do except patrol, pull guard, and jack off. Generally you jack off during guard. The US Army invented jacking off on guard duty. It's on Wikipedia and everything. 

Oh, and we drew dicks on everything. Walls of the guard shack? Dicks. Walls of the shitter? Dicks. Random cat wandering the ground? Dicks. 

Why dicks? I have no earthly idea. How? I don't know that either. I doubt I ever saw a Sharpie in Iraq, but there's probably still sharpie dicks littering that entire country. 

When the Iraqis took over that post, I imagine some poor  joe in the Iraqi Army had to report to his sergeant like, ""Sir, there's dicks everywhere. Even on the cat. What should we do?"" 

And an Iraqi sergeant, with a far off look in his eye, says, ""We continue their warrior tradition. Bring me the sheep. They missed him."" He crushes out his smoke and looks into the gathering darkness. ""We draw dicks now. To honor those that fought here before us. Sic Semper Dickus."" 

Anyway.

One night, we get tasked to do an overwatch. If you're not familiar with the parlance, essentially we'd drive out somewhere we expected insurgents to be doing dirty shit, hide, wait for them to do some dirty shit, and then try to do some dirty shit to them instead. Mostly we just smoked cigarettes, chewed tobacco, rode the wild tiger*, and stared at green tinted scenery**.


This night we get dropped off, and it's dead ass dark, man. No moon, just stars, and Mosul doesn't have much electricity, so it's a fuckin’ tomb out there. We're over watching a graveyard this time, cuz sometimes they'd hide weapons caches in graves, come back later and pick them back up at their leisure. Basically the grimmest Easter egg hunt you can think of.

 We decide to pick a dark house at the end of a row of houses, break in, clear it, and watch from the rooftop. This is pretty standard, but nothing gives an infantryman a gemstone class erection like doing anything even remotely high speed. Night infils definitely qualify. We're all painted up like goddamn Mohawks, gear silenced, fueled by nothing but two hours of sleep, nicotine, and a frankly irresponsible amount of rip-its*** and wild tiger.

The thing about Iraqi houses though, most have high wall around 'em, maybe 10 feet tall, and equally high gates. They surround an inner courtyard area where they park their cars. This is supposed to be a commando type situation, so we're supposed to go over the walls, open the gate, into the house, no noise. 


Next to the wall is something that looks like a steel shed, so a decision was made, and I was volunteered to go over the wall. Specialist in the Army is the shittiest rank ever. You've got enough rank to be trusted with the relatively important shit no one else wants to have to do, but not enough rank to avoid doing it. For every sergeant in the Army, there's a specialist out there doing the shit job he was originally tasked with. Which I suppose is the point of the rank.


So I'm the one over the goddamn wall, I guess. I climb onto this steel shed, and reach up, but I'm still well short of getting over this thing. So one of our FNGs**** clambers up next to me, and he's gonna boost me over. I'm making sure to stay on the roof beams of this rickety ass shed, and he does too. I reach up, touching the top of the wall, checking for a Mosul security system. That's when the residents crush up glass and put it on top of the wall, stopping random assholes from crawling over it. As I, a random asshole, was preparing to do. Thankfully, the owner of this wall clearly didn't care enough about his privacy to install one. Now I was wearing gloves, but I was still cautious. 


An infantryman's job is literally his hands. My old squad leader used to say, “Never put your hands anywhere you wouldn't put your dick. Or vice versa.” He told me this while hocking dip spit into ankle deep water (due to a clogged drain) as he was cleaning up (bare assed) after a patrol in a shower with no curtain. This advice, nay this entire scenario, makes no fucking sense but it did two things. One, I always wore gloves on patrol. And two, I seriously rethought the class of biddies I was chasing after in my off hours.


So no security system. I put my boot in FNGs hands, and push off. I get launched up, but just before that point of equilibrium where I can pull myself up, the entire shed decides, “I definitely did not volunteer to support 500lbs of capitalist American pigdog.” and gives up the ghost. My guy crashes through the shed but I've got the top of the wall, so maybe I've got this right? Ha Ha. Fuck no. Because remember when I said the owner clearly didn't care about his privacy? He also didn't give a fuck about mortaring in the last two rows of cinder blocks on his perimeter wall, either. 


Ever seen a dog trying to jump onto the couch, but he can't quite make it, and falls the fuck over? Like that. Except now I've got 100lbs of cinder blocks crashing down on my goddamn head. It breaks my night vision off my helmet, and nearly my head off my neck. 


Essentially, real, real fucking stealthy. 600lbs of dumbass and cinder block falling onto a collapsed steel shed at 1am. 


I'm mildly concussed, and my FNG is groaning cuz he took a block of concrete to the coin purse, but we're ok. I look at the wall and no shit, there's a fucking hole in it near the bottom! It's not big, but big enough to squeeze through. So I do, and open the gate to let in a squad of seriously sheepish looking hard chargers. I hear a baby crying in the house, and we all know this op is straight fucked up. So we go, open the door and walk in. The house is dark, and we start waking them up. Weird thing though, no baby. So I start trying to find this noise, and I follow it back outside.


Turns out, if you crush an entire chicken coop under the weight of two armored men and a quarter of a wall, a squashed chicken makes a sound oddly reminiscent of a crying baby. And that little doorway? It was the entrance the chickens used to get into the courtyard. So I was also covered in chicken shit. Our interpreter walks out, surveys the fowl carnage we’ve wreaked, and says, deadpan, “He wants you to pay for the chickens.” And what the fuck can I do but pay for the chickens?


Keep in mind, I'm mildly concussed, so I just hand over my wallet and get absolutely mugged in the most polite fashion possible, cuz there's no way in hell there was $100 USD worth of chickens and shed involved in that shit show. I realize this later of course, once my brain stops rattling in my head like a dried navy bean in a paint shaker.

TL;DR I crashed through a rickety steel chicken coop and got at least a dozen confirmed chicken kills during Operation Iraqi Freedom. 


'Merica.

TIFU by not taking free advice,"It’s was a long time ago, young and stupid sums it up best ! 
Meet this beautiful young lady, Sam, farmers daughter and from a very wealthy family. We had a couple of dates and things where going well so decided to have a Sunday jolly down the Norfolk coast in the uk. 
Being the sort of guy who likes to impress a girl decided to take my old E-Type Jaguar for a run. I had spent 3 years doing a full nut and bolt rebuild including new chrome wire wheels, respray, new chrome and all the stuff you do when rebuilding a classic car. 
I picked her up at 9 am looking forwards to leisurely drive along the coast and stopping at Wells next to sea for a spot of Sunday lunch. 
We arrive at Wells, I pull onto the only car park I can find directly in front of a lovely only country hotel and pub looking forwards to a great Roast Beef Sunday lunch and all the trimmings. I put my money in the parking meter and just as I’m about to put the ticket on my car this oldish guy approaches me. 
“You can’t part there” he tells me in his thick Norfolk accent, I turn around tell him it’s a public car park, I’ve paid for me ticket and I will park where ever I want. He tells me again I can’t park there but being  22 and knowing everything in the world there is to know I ignored him, left my car gleaming in the mid day sun. It looked fantastic with its shiny new Carmen red paint work, wheels catching the sun from the shining new chrome wheels. 
We walk into hotel and get shown to table, we sit and order and go for the carvery option, roast beef and it looked mouth watering good. We get our food and eat our first course and just as we are waiting for sweet trolly to arrive I notice people keep walking to the window, looking out, looking at us and almost laughing. 
To be honest I didn’t think much off it, Norfolk is a strange county and not all that welcoming to strangers. We finished our food, I paid the bill and left. 
Just as I walk out side I notice quite a crowd of people looking towards the car park I had parked in it was at this point reality hit me. 
The guy was totally correct, the car park I had parked in was now under around 3 feet of water and beloved E-Type was almost totally submerged with only the roof showing. The first person who greeted me was the old guy, he looked me straight in the eye “told you you couldn’t park their” was his only comment. The car park was on part of the tidal area that floods at high tide, my car was totally wrecked even the interior was full of muddy salt water. 
How I wished I had listened to his well meaning advice instead of being a dick ! 

TL;DR  I messed up by parking in a stupid place by taking good well meaning advice as possible rudeness. Leading to the flooding of my beloved car after spending 3 years renovating it.

TIFU by almost setting my dad's place on fire,"Obligatory **this didn't happen today** but many years ago. I think I was about 13 at the time and it was on a weekend late in january.

My dad had told me that it was time to finally cut down the christmas tree because it had aged and dried visibly and that he'd probably get to it in the next few days. He had already forbidden any candles near the tree weeks before.

Now this message hit me - hard! I loved fir trees! Even when this one was barely taller than me at the time and it's needles had already become to resemble more of old peoples' hair in colour instead of the strong and deep green that had enriched our holiday just a few weeks before.

Also I loved burning candles and the only thing better than either of those things was both combined at the same time! So while my dad was busy sneaky little [u/rumlyne](https://new.reddit.com/u/rumlyne) grabbed a few candles and matches and got to work.

I diligently redecorated the front of the dry old tree with 5 of those candles (didn't care about the other christmas shit) and made sure there was at least 10cm (4 inches) between the top of each candle and the branches above and around - I wasn't that stupid, I knew that old fir trees are susceptable to combustion but 10cm (4 inches) must be more than enough, right? **RIGHT?!**

The answer obviously was no.

I lit a match and with it the first candle on chest height and while I was moving to the next one suddenly my spidey senses began to tingle...

What happened from there may have taken about 1.5-2 seconds but it felt (and still feels) like it all happend in quarter of a second - at the most.

*internal* // **audible** // story

*\*tingle tingle\**

My eyes moved back to the 1st candle which was burning happily with a stable, perfectly happy little candle flame with a height of about 1 cm, in it's unthreatening, soothing, intimate, just average candle like manner - *So nice...*

Then I looked up to the branch above and at this exact moment:

\***crackle crackle\***

The fir needles on the branche (easily 10cm (4 inces)) above suddenly burst into bright red flames! *Oh sh...*

The flames were jumping from one needle to the next in a rapid manner - kinda like dominoes just a lot more threatetning!

*..it!!!*

**\*crackle crackle crackl**\*ing increasingly

The fire had reached the rough size and form of my head - it was like staring at a reflection of my own blazing stupidity and hubris.

Adrenalin had now reached peak levels and thinking intensified. Lightening fast I assessed the situation:

*water? too far away/no hose/no bucket (at least not easily accessable)*

*floor - wood*

*tree stand - wood*

*direct link found. shit*

*right (of tree): doorframe? wood. bad*

*more right (of tree): couch? flammable. bad*

*left (of tree): curtains? linen. VERY BAD*

*no direct link (to tree)! no direct link between candle and branch either. certainty cannot be guaranteed. shit*

I put out the match since more fire would not contribute to a solution.

*call dad? too far away, too slow. room on fire by then*

So I did the only thing I could do:

I took a deep deep breath, a breath so deep and so fast I didn't know was humanly possible. My lungs stretched like they had never done before, bulging against my intestines stretching into every nook and cranny in my torso they could find.

Then I blew it all out into the heart of that fiery demon I had summoned. It flickered and clung to the needles, went out in some places only to flare up again seemingly just to spite me but it only strenghend my resolve (that and the trouble I'd be in after burning the f\*\*\*ing house down)!

The deamon had shrunk in size significantly but still wouldn't let go of the branches, wrapping around them. Too much power would push the fire onto yet unburnt parts of the tree, yet too little would result in the whole tree going up in a inferno. Control was key, just like in picking up a cat that's clawing into your favourite new sofa - to little force and it won't let go, to much and you tear open the sofa. This was a dificult line to walk, especially under the pressure! My air reserves were draining fast, I maybe had 20&#37; air left, 25&#37; at the most. I began hastily waving my hands in an effort to further increase airflow towards the tree.

With a last pressing effort; with what seemed like the force of a thousand winds I finally managed to blow/wave out the fire and sent that demon back to hell. I must've stood there a good 3 minutes displaying a mixture of pride because of my accomplishment, terror while I went through all the ways in which this could've and maybe should've gone horribly wrong and relief.

When I later told my dad that I had almost killed us both and explained the situation his reaction was: ""You're stupid but at least you're just as lucky."" I had no rebuttal, it was true.

So please children do not underestimate the dryness and combustibility of old firs. This could've gone horribly wrong and ended as a newspaper footnote or a dot in a statistic of horrible and unnecessary deaths.

TL;DR - I underestimated the dryness of an old christmas tree and it's willingless to kill us all if given a chance.

TIFU by going to a physiotherapist,"This happened to me today, only about two hours ago and is without a doubt one of the most horrifically embarrassing moments of my life. I'm still physically recovering from this ordeal, and hope to post this as a cathartic means to deal wih what happened, and what I did.

This afternoon I went to see a physiotherapist. It was my first time going to a physio, and I didn't really know what to expect. I was going as I've had some lower back troubles - this is unrelated but I'm setting the scene. What IS important to know is this clinic didnt have singular walled rooms for clients - we were separated by beds and those hospital-like curtains that when drawn, give privacy from one another. I'm not sure if this is normal practice to be honest, but you can hear all the other people talking while getting physio from behind these curtains. This is a key detail which make everything that happened much much worse.

As expected, I'm asked to put on a hospital-type gown that exposes my back, but I'm asked to also change into boxers. Again, not super sure if this is standard physio practice but I dutifully do as asked. The guy doing my physio was lovely but some of the exercises he asked me to do made me feel a bit dizzy, a bit out of breath and due to the tension I was under by completing these exercises (am slightly unfit right now also), I got a bit of a headache. He did some massage on my back after all this, then topped it all off by covering my entire back with a mound of hot towels (i think it was anyway) as I laid on my stomach. He left me on my own while I ""destressed"" for a few minutes, and this where the trouble began.

I started to feel dizzy and nauseous straight away. My stomach became upset, like hard like a rock, and it was difficult to lay still as it was quite uncomfortable. I thought about calling out to the guy but I'm super awkward with that kind of thing and so decided to stick it out. After a few minutes of intense discomfort (and overheating due to the constant heat of the towels), I surprisingly start to feel more comfortable and relaxed - my stomach ""deflates"" and I just kind of feel out of the woods. I think to myself, maybe I was just feeling sick due to the hot towel pressing down on my stomach. 

Guy comes back and removes the towel and basically says I'm good to leave. He leaves me then, closes the curtain again and I sit up on the bed to get changed.

Immediately I'm hit with a powerful and intense wave of nausea and my stomach clenches really hard reflexively. Within possibly a few seconds, my mouth starts to salivate intensely.

This is where I fucked up. 

In my defense, I havent been sick in years and really forgot how outside of your control it can be. So I made the conscious decision to fight it, thinking the saliva would go away if I concentrated really hard. Thinking I maybe might make it to the carpark if I really had to vomit. I try to fight the saliva and realise I'm still sitting down in these hospital-like clothes and in my warped decision-making, decide to try and get changed. I managed to peel off the shorts and put on my leggings. I also manage to take off the gown and put on my bra, all the while profusely swallowing the mouthfuls of saliva I'm producing in great amounts, which is just replaced by MORE saliva. All this took maybe 5-10 intense, painstaking seconds. 

After putting on my bra, I was overcome with nausea so I paused and sat on the bed to reevaluate my plan. As soon as my ass hit the bed, my stomach tightened and I kind of burped, and with this, up comes a bit of vomit, which I then hold in my mouth. 

Things are deteriorating fast and now I realise that shit, I'm really going to throw up. Things starts to brew down there and I'm barely keeping it down, the little bit I had thrown up already meant that more was going to follow and I couldn't stop it. I get up and see a singular bin against the wall and launch myself over to it. It's one of those bins with a lid, and a floor pedal to lift it. In my haste, I bend down and try to open it with my hand. Just as I touch the lid, an unrelenting torrent of vomit is projectiled from my stomach, through my mouth and all over the bin lid, which ricochets off the lid onto the wall and carpet. CARPET. 

At this time I think I audibly said ""FUCK"" and in my vomit-induced brain, think I can somehow scrape the vomit off the lid with my bare hands and into the bin to hide most of the evidence. As I proceed to try to do so, my stomach convulses again and I vomit once more, missing the bin entirely and instead, plastering the wall with hot, steaming vomit, which proceeds to slide down the wall behind the bin. 

What's worse is that I had carrots as part of my lunch, and noticed, even then in my delirum, half digested carrot chunks swimming in the pool of vomit covering the bin. 

I'm paralysed, shaking, and as I'm standing over my home-brewed pool of filth, the physio comes back and pulls aside the curtain, asking if I'm okay. I just look at him, standing there half naked (almost), with some vomit in my hair and on .t leggings. I just say ""I just fucking vomited"" in disbelief. 

I'm not sure if he saw (from his standpoint) the utter carnage on the floor and that I missed the bin, because he was so nice about what happened. He gave me some water and privacy to get changed, and didn't even make a big deal about it.

I had to take a few minutes to compose myself before I made the walk of shame down to the front counter, smelling slightly of vomit. I have never been so embarrassed in my entire life.

The worst thing about this whole thing is that in retrospect, every other client there getting physio - hell, even the ones in the waiting room down the front - probably heard the whole thing unfold. And, I had already been booked to go back this next Friday.

TIFU By Taking Off My Watch And Playing Smash Bros,"Hullo Reddit, unlike most stories on here this actually did happen today, with a mix of yesterday. 

I recently just moved to Madison, Wisconsin to split the rent with my aunt and apparently there's a lot of crime up in these parts that I didn't know about. It was the first time I've left the house since my stay and I was having a pretty great day, that last night I was going to go to a Smashfest where people go to to meet up and just play Super Small Bros. I was supposed to be there at six but I got there at seven thirty because I was lost, but once I was there everything was great and I met some friendly people. 

Here's where I fuck up. I got uncomfortable sitting with my phone in my back pocket, so I put it on the table, and while playing I took off my watch because my wrist was hurting (I wear my watch on my right hand). As there weren't any clocks in the room and I was having fun, I completely lost track of the time. While in my smash-induced high, apparently my aunt tried calling me a bunch of times wondering where I was since I said I would be home by ten to ten thirty. When I finally started to go home in realized it was four-forty-four. I was playing small non-stop for about ten hours and had no idea. I never heard my phone ring and I didn't have the time on me and I know it was just me being irresponsible and fucking up.

The worst part about this is the fact that I don't know my aunt that well as we haven't spent that much time together and she doesn't believe for one second I wasn't at my phone because at home I'm always on it since there's nobody there. Typically when I'm at any social event I put away my phone so I can actually talk to people. 

But whatever, I'm not trying to make excuses, in reality I was just being irresponsible and needed to be more considerate of my aunt, she was just worried about me. But it is called Today I Fucked Up, isn't it?

TL;DR

I lost track of time and worried my aunt by not responding to her or coming home until a ridiculous time in the morning in a crime ridden city.",0,6/15/2018 18:22,tifu,callMeKenpai,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8rcp7x/tifu_by_taking_off_my_watch_and_playing_smash_bros/,/r/tifu/comments/8rcp7x/tifu_by_taking_off_my_watch_and_playing_smash_bros/,8rcp7x,"You were supposed to be home three hours later and stayed for ten?

TIFU by throwing away a coworker's toy,"After lurking on TIFU for several years I finally have something worth sharing.

Obligatory this was not today, but several days ago when I was just getting ready to leave for work. In the back room as I was grabbing my stuff out of my locker I saw a little Wolverine action figure. Without thinking about it I threw him away as I assumed it was just some toy that a child had left by accident... Turns out it belonged to a coworker of mine, and he was upset that it was thrown away as it was a present from his deceased father he got when he was a kid. I obviously feel bad about this but I feel there is nothing I can do to replace the one his father got him. Thankfully, I leave for vacation tomorrow so I wont have to see him for at least a week. Any advice on how I should handle this would be much appreciated. 

TL;DR: Threw away a coworkers sentimental action figure, now he is very upset with me.

"TIFU by giving myself a permanent marker / sharpie tattoo and wrecking my school shirt, pillow cover and sheet.","Gonna try and make this short and snappy because this fuck up is still happening. Tiny backstory: I am a really really *reaaaallly* bad procrastinator. I will watch Netflix, watch the 'The Last of Us Part II gameplay' trailer over and over, play the guitar very poorly, I will read a book. I just cannot study for more than an hour at a time. It's really bad. Anyway! So last night, after studying for about 10 minutes for my upcoming Math B test next Monday, I decided to take my normal procrastination break.  


Obviously, this is where the fuck up begins. I look to the right of my computer and see a Permanent Marker I was using for one of my other subjects. Being a big fan of The Last of Us, and after seeing [Ellie's tattoo](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/thelastofus/images/4/42/TLOU2_-_Ellie_tattoo.png/revision/latest?cb=20161204160926) in the first trailer, I decided I really wanted to give myself the same tattoo. Using the sharpie I decided to draw a (pretty awesome) similar design to the tattoo over my shoulder and arm. I drew it so no one would notice and my clothes would cover it. I thought I was so smart.  


Jump to this afternoon when I got home and took off my *white* *shirt* which inside is **COVERED** in black shit... I panicked. I ran to my bed and saw my sheets and pillow case was covered in the black shit as well. My mum is home by the way, and if she finds out, is going to kill me. I just washed my pillow cover and put it in the dryer. It still had the mark on it. I'm so fucked. I've hidden my white shirt under my bed to have a crack at cleaning it tonight when my parents have gone to bed. So yeah. That's my fuck up. I've never posted here in TIFU, so I hope I haven't broken any rules. I will edit this post in a little bit to tell you all if I get caught or not. Ah well.  

TL;DR: I drew a badass Ellie from TLOU tattoo on my shoulder with sharpie, accidentally ruined my bed sheets, pillow case and white school shirt. Mum's gonna kill me.  

*Edit: Dryer just finished, pillow case is screwed... ah well. Thinking of telling mum. I'll give it a crack with some other stuff first later tonight when she's asleep.

Enter their reality. Dont tell them what they think is wrong or different ask them to tell you more. If you correct them it can be quite distressing.

Don't argue back or correct them. If you do need them to understand, show them. If they think it is middle of the day, take them to the window and show them it's night. 

Patience. Give them time.

Someone who dementia when they get physically violent they aren't 'aggressive' they are scared. This is a common one In healthcare where patients can get this label.

Don't let doctors over prescribe. Doctors are terrible for prescribing meds left right and centre and actually for an elderly person that can cause more confusion and change of behaviour. Always ask for a medication review regularly with your physician.

Therapeutic lying... If they think they are waiting for their bus to see their mother (who died 30years ago). Dont tell them they are wrong. Validate, respond to their reality, its heartbreaking but I have often told patients a taxi is on the way to collect them or have let them sit at my desk waiting for a bus because it kept them calm. We once had an ex secretary on the unit and we let her file some (old) notes for us one shift!

Go for walks. Keep on top of physical health. Sometimes patients like to wander or pace up and down. Walk with them, have a chat, make sure they have good footwear though!

Care for the carer. You need to look after yourself. It can be exhausting so self care is also important.


I can't think of any more... But that's all from a nurse who loves her job! ",CA[deleted],1,21:17.0

"TIFU by trying to be kinky, ended up in tears","So this wasn’t today but a few nights back, some friends said I should share what happened here.
After a night of clubbing I got home with my boyfriend and we started to fuck, both of us being really drunk - I’m the only person he’s been with so he’s not the most experienced.
After a while I decided to be more frisky and I told him he could slap me if he wanted to.
Surprised, excited, inexperienced and wasted, he slaps me across the face like Mike Tyson on crack - and continues to do this 3 or 4 more times before I have to physically force him off me, crying my eyes out and I continued to cry for half an hour after - I seriously thought I had a concussion 

Note: He’s always been super caring and the best boyfriend someone could have - he even took me to dinner the next day as an apology

But the whole situation I think has put me off trying to be kinky until I’m old and need it

TIFU by making a twitter to sell pictures of my feet and alerting all my friends/family,"This was two days ago, and I still find it really funny.  
I was bored one night, and feeling confident after having a conversation with a girl at work about how she sells pictures of her feet online decided, ""Hey, why not? I'm not weirded out easily and that sounds beneficial for myself and the other party involved.""  
So, I've never had a Twitter and decided I'd make one for this reason. My name, age, a picture is all on this new Twitter and I make my first post about trying to find anyone who is interested in feet photographs, etc. The next morning I wake up and figure it's actually pretty silly and delete the text.  
Later that night my boyfriend and I are laying in bed and he looks at me and says, ""Why did you make a Twitter to sell pictures of your feet?"" I laughed and told him the truth: I thought it'd be a fun, easy way to maybe make some extra cash or get a free pedicure.  
He then told me that when I made a Twitter and tweeted my first post it notified all of my phone contacts. So, now all of my friends and some family know I was entertaining the idea of selling photographs of my feet online.  
I find the whole thing really funny and was joking about bringing it up when I see my Dad tomorrow to what he would say.

TIFU by possibly making a kid a paraplegic.,"I'm fucking pissed.

I'm giving some passengers, a young couple in town, a ride to St. Anne's. We're having a great conversation and coming down Harry Hines. We're on the left lane, and this city worker was coming out of a ditch on the right slowly, with his hazards on. This other dude is coming in at like 50 mph and slams into the truck. He cusses about ""where the fuck did that guy come out of,"" backs out and takes off. The guy passenger in my car takes pictures and gets the dude's license plate, and I tell the girl to call 9-11.

I park and the dude and I get out and go over to the guy. I didn't wanna look inside because the front of the truck was all smashed in, and I never get used to seeing someone dead. Someone said he was out cold. His airbags deployed. Then the post starts leaning more, and the power lines start stretching. The post cracks and snaps something and a huge voltage flame shoots out.

No one wants to move the guy because with a collision like that, you can seriously fuck them up more. Then someone yells that the truck is leaking gas like a mother fucker and they keep a perimeter.

One of the scariest fucking things I've ever had to do in my life, but the thought of the flames reaching the gas and burning the dude alive... I couldn't stand around. I ran to the passenger side and unbuckled the guy's seatbelt and shouted at him to wake up. Blood, drool, and snot are coming out of his mouth. He's fucked up. I can smell the gas, and the cables are stretching even more. So now it's not just burning to death. There's a possibility for electrocution.

So, fuck it. I run over to the driver's side and grab the guy. He couldn't have been more than 120lb and was about 5'8"". I never realized how heavy deadweight actually is. All I'm thinking is, ""Not today. Not today. Not today. Don't let me burn. Don't let me get electrocuted. Not today."" This dude was HEAVY and I'm struggling. The other dudes come running to help and we haul his ass to the median.

And the fucked up thing is that while all this is happening, I'm still thinking about that cunt that hit him just dipping the fuck out of there. This kid... he couldn't have been older than 25... could have fucking died and the other dude just fucking left.

A woman in blue scrubs, couldn't tell if she was a nurse, doctor, or tech, and an EMT with a first aid kit were nearby (it's the medical district, after all) and we all tried keeping the kid awake. The EMT asks his name, and the kid's just mumbling. I start talking to him in Spanish. Blue Scrubs is telling him to stay awake, and we check his his torso. He's got a fractured clavicle... a nasty bruise on it.

The ambulance and firetruck arrive, horns blaring. Although only a few minutes passed, that shit felt like an hour. I'm proud of Madi (the female passenger who called 9-11). She gave perfect directions. I'm holding the kid's hand just trying to let him know... we're all letting him know that he's okay. He's finally conscious and speaks english. He's local. And he just starts crying.

""You're gonna be alright, dude. They're here to help you. You're okay."" His grip's weak.

Then he says it. ""I can't feel anything. I can't feel anything. My back.""

That shit sinks me. I look at his legs, and he's moving them. ""You're okay, man. You're moving your legs. It's the shock. You're moving them."" And I'm telling him this because I'm a selfish, scared piece of shit and I don't wanna take the blame for possibly making him a paraplegic. But he WAS moving his legs. He was flexing his feet. I want him to know that he's gonna walk. He can still walk.

I'm pissed at myself almost as much as I'm pissed at that abysmal coward who couldn't face the destruction he caused and lambed. The paramedics get the stretcher and I gotta let go of the kid's hand. I tell him he's gonna be alright, but I just don't know.

The adrenaline is dying down. I probably stink like a goddamn dumpster. And I'm alone with my thoughts. I couldn't stand it, so I wrote this, because I want you to know that if this kid's a paraplegic, it's my fault.  


TL;DR: A kid in a really bad collision was knocked out. Power lines were dangerously close to snapping. His truck is leaking gasoline and there's a potential for fire as well as electrocution. I made the decision to pull him out because I couldn't bear the thought of him burning to death or being electrocuted. But even after the ambulance had picked him up and taken him, no fire started and no power lines snapped, and I may have simply made his spine worse.

TIFU by giving a young lady a permanent facial scar,"As tradition, this did not happen today, but probably around 15 years ago when I was around 10 years old or younger. I've been blocking this memory out for those 15 years and unfortunately a TIFU post reminded me of it... it still makes me cringe and embarrassed today this day.

It's a bit hazy but it goes like this... It was me, my 2 cousins and their 2 girlfriends (or friends, doesn't matter). The fatal decision that day was made by my Uncle who decided it was a great idea to give us all golf clubs and a bucket of golf balls, and then basically told us to go *knock our selves out*. 

Now before I tell you what happened next, let me tell you about me. I'm usually completely unaware and oblivious of what's going on around me, so this is no surprise that this happened but0 it was only partially my fault... at least thats what I like to believe.

So I'm standing there putting the ball trying to get it in this hole when one of the girls comes up behinds me and watches me (without my knowledge), and then for whatever reason I decided at that point in time that putting was boring and I wanted to see how far I could hit the ball, as you can probably guess what happens next. I swang the golf club over my shoulder and with all my force, hit that ball as hard as I could.

Only to my horror I turn around and see this young lady on the floor with a huge gash on her face crying on the floor

Poor girl had a permanent facial scar. That's all I know. I've never spoken to her since and stayed well away from golf clubs.

TIFU by ignoring doctor's orders and nearly killing myself.,"This didn't happen today, but yesterday, so the pain is still very real.

I have COPD, a very serious lung disease that eventually requires a lung transplant to fix it. I had spent the week living in a hotel room near my hospital getting evaluated, which includes a battery of tests. I was poked and prodded and jabbed and lost more blood than CM Punk in the UFC.

Two days ago (Thursday) I had a test so serious it requires a surgical team. A catheter was inserted into my wrist, up the main artery in my arm, and used to inject dye into my heart to measure it's behavior. I was *seriously* doped up for this test, so I wouldn't accidentally move and rip out the catheter and send blood hurtling towards the ceiling in a grotesque *True Blood* fountain.

After the test, I was very specifically warned not to exert myself for 48 hours, not to use my arm for anything strenuous, and to be under **constant supervision** by another person. So, of course, the next morning I got myself dropped off for another round of tests and told my caregiver to come back for me in 8 hours.

The test involved eating a very small meal (the only thing I was allowed to eat since the previous night), and having my stomach PET-scanned after 1, 2 and 4 hours. After the 2 hour check, I was incredibly bored, so I went outside and started walking around. (Full disclosure: I was hunting Pokemon. Hospitals, especially famous Children's Hospitals, are *havens* of Pokemon and Pokestops.)

After a while I sat down on a bench, in the sun, and fell asleep. Normally when I sleep I require oxygen to keep my blood O2 levels up, but this time I just fell out unexpectedly. So, I woke up already low on oxygen, and began feeling nauseous. At this point all I cared about was finishing this stupid test, and I was pretty sure puking up my breakfast would ruin it. So, I decided the right thing to do was move out of the sunlight into the shade, and start making my way back inside.

So, I stood up, and instead of heading about 6 inches to my right to the shady side of the bench, I began moving uphill towards the next bench, about 50 feet from where I was. I immediately felt light-headed, woozy, and dizzy. So, of course my immediate reaction was to ~~sit back down~~ make a run for it and hope I got to the bench before I passed out.

Spoiler: I did not.

Within about 5 steps, I suddenly felt my legs refuse to move where I told them, got them twisted around each other, and fell face first onto the ground. Thankfully, by sheer luck, I fell into the grass, and didn't hit any of the trees, rocks, or metal furniture in the immediate area. After laying there for about 2 minutes, I finally sat up and assumed the ""Triangle of Respiratory Distress"" pose, which looks roughly similar to a panicked person having a mental breakdown. A staff member came over and eventually a doctor and nurse got me wheelchaired up and back into the place.

Unfortunately, on impact I used my bandaged, off-limits arm to catch myself, which merely served to swing me sideways so my rib cage landed directly on my portal oxygen tank. Once I got back into the building, I noticed that I was having (more than usual) serious trouble breathing, and there was a nice bruise spreading quickly up my arm.

I guess if there's any place you need to fall down into a life-threatening condition, outside a hospital medical plaza isn't a bad choice. but if I had landed a few feet to the left, or fallen the other direction, or the staff member hadn't chosen that time to do some gardening, most likely I would have bled out while suffocating to death in my confusion. My chest still hurts, and I have to be on oxygen full time until the soreness dissipates and I can breathe again.

All because big bad me ""didn't really need"" constant supervision after major surgery.

TL;DR Ignored direct doctors orders, overextended myself after surgery, passed out, and only by sheer luck did not suffer and permanent harm, merely excruciating pain in my ribs and a long-term connection to my home oxygen.",35,6/17/2018 0:17,tifu,KutuluMike,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8rn3bk/tifu_by_ignoring_doctors_orders_and_nearly/,/r/tifu/comments/8rn3bk/tifu_by_ignoring_doctors_orders_and_nearly/,8rn3bk,"One could say you were given a second wind.

TIFU by making the cunnilingus sign at someone I wanted to dance with,"You know how when you're nervous you try to do or say one thing, but stumble over yourself and it comes out entirely another way? The ""ARE YOU FUCKING SORRY?"" tumblr soccer story is a good example. Well, add alcohol to that and you get how I fucked up today. 

I was dancing with a group of strangers at a bar, trying to get a dancing partner for one of the slow songs on rotation. None really attractive but I was just looking to dance anyhow. A ballad comes around and as they go back to their booth, I ask the cutest one if she'd care to dance, and she declined.

What I *meant* to do was to stick my tongue out mock-sneeringly and play it off cool (I was a bit bummed out) and go my own way. Perhaps it was my libido reaching up through my liquor-softened consciousness, but what I *did* was put my fingers in a V to my mouth (as if holding a cigarette) and stick out my tongue through that. As I was doing it I realized I was fucking up, and I just turned and left to hate myself at the bar for one more song, and then left as swiftlyand confidently as possible (not very), having to pass the booth on the way out.

TIFU by accidentally making a noxious gas in a mildly unexpected way,"As usual, it was a few weeks ago I fucked up, but I didn't think to post it until now.

I was home by myself and decided to dye my hair using one of the simple at-home kits, which I have done before. I got everything mixed up, put it in my hair, and waited the standard amount of time.

Well, this was my first time colouring my hair since I had moved into my new house, and I really didn't want to stain my bathtub in my bathroom (it has tile and grout around the edges), nor get in the shower to rinse it out (last time I did so, I ended up with a pink face and back for about 24 hours which was not ideal). So instead, I decided to use my guest bathroom with a shower/tub combo and stick my head under the faucet.

All goes well, but I realized that the tub didn't drain quite as fast as I expected. I got a cup and tried rinsing/diluting the dyed water as it drained, but unfortunately I ended up with a pretty extensively bright pink dyed tub bottom. Honestly, I didn't really care that much since no one used the tub there and I could just close the shower curtain and poof, no big deal!

So a few days later, my mom says she would like to come visit me, so I realized I should probably take care of the tub problem... I had already run some water through it and tried rubbing at the stain with my feet a few times, but obviously, that didn't help much.

I didn't do any research on what I should use and didn't really think to check, since I pretty much only have a handful of staple cleaning supplies, so I decided to try Scrubbing Bubbles, because bleach is usually the dangerous on, right? Apparently not this time. 

I start spraying it along the bottom of the bathtub. Yay, I can see the foam turning pink! It's working! As I sprayed, my dog had come in to see what's up as usual. Watching the foam, I hear her make a weird cough/hack noise, though pretty quiet. I don't really think much of it because she is kind of a snorty-sounding dog so she clears her throat and sneezes a lot. Well, she REALLY starts to make a hacking noise now, and starts sneezing, but she doesn't really move away or do anything. 

Thinking she's just got something in her throat, I kneel down to pat her on the back when my eyes are assaulted by this god-awful burning sensation. As soon as I inhale, I get a terrible tickle in the back of my throat that immediately makes me sputter and feel like I'm choking on a hot pepper. Apparently I made some sort of noxious gas from the dye and the cleaning supplies?? 

Tearing up, I shoo her quickly out of the bathroom and shut the door to keep her out, then start frantically looking around to figure out how to fix this. I turn on the bathroom vent which honestly does nothing, and there is no window to open, so I start panicking because I'm really starting to choke now, but I need to stop this gas from being made. 

I take a deep breath (bad, stupid idea) which almost immediately makes me start choking, but I decide to try to rinse out the tub to get rid of the foam which, I figured at least, would keep mixing with the dye if I didn't get it out. I also didn't really want it eroding the seal on my bathtub if I just left it there.

It took me a very long minute to finally get the tub empty with tears streaming down my face and fighting the urge to cough and breath down by the tub, but I finally clear rinse the last of it and run out and shut the door behind me.

Cue like the next hour of persistent coughing and sniffling (if you have ever smoked a cigarette for the first time in a long time, it was kind of like the day after that). Dog was fine, thank goodness, but I started to think how stupid it was to have shut the door on myself in a non-ventilated bathroom *when I was home alone.* The coughing didn't go away for several hours after. When I finally checked the tub again, of course, it was still light pink-stained... So pretty much all of that happened for nothing, and I finally got most of the stain out over the next year by periodically using the tub. [It's still a little pink today.](https://i.imgur.com/BzRoOqh.jpg) Go me.

TIFU by nearly killing myself and my fiance with a humidifier,"Actually today, so woot.

Last night my fiance and I went to see The Incredibles 2. When we got back, I pulled a humidifier out of storage because we both have sinus problems. It smelled a little moldy, so I figured I would clean it out, no big deal. 

This morning we both woke up with headaches, nausea, and asthma-like symptoms. We were coughing, couldn't breathe, I could barely walk and we had terrible headaches. We eventually figured out it was probably because I diluted a couple table spoons of isopropyl alcohol with a half gallon of water, and we spent all night inhaling alcohol vapor.

We've never been drunk before, and I'm just glad I didn't kill us with alcohol-poisoning in our sleep.

TL;DR

Don't put alcohol in your humidifier or you may wake up with a hangover.

TIFU by gargling with saltwater for strep throat and messing up my middle ear,"This happened today, about 3 hours ago, and I am writing this with one hand on my right ear, hoping to distract me from some of the pain.

You know how the most common remedy (at least where I live) for strep thoat is to mix some water with salt and gargle with it? I always do this when I have a sore throat and it works miracles.

Some 3 hours ago (2AM) I decided to gargle with salt water before I go to sleep. Everything went fine, until I randomly yawned while still having some saltwater in my throat.

Time for a biology lesson. The throat and nose are directly connected to the middle ear by some canals, in the upper part of the throat, not normally accessible (I am describing this because most people I told this to - including my parents - aren't aware that the ears are connected to the throat). When you yawn, those canals open to let air pass through.

So when this happened, salt water got into my middle ear. It wasn't much but I felt it hard.

First there was a horrible burn-like pain for a few minutes paired with the obvious ""stuffed ear feeling"". The pain went away after a few minutes and eventually it only started to itch and feel weird. I waited for about 1 hour and went to bed, saying to myself that I'll be fine when I wake up.

Fast forward 2 hours later when I am awaken by agonizing ear pain and the feeling like my ear is about to explode. Also completely stuffed, can't ""pop my ear"" when yawning.

I took a pain killer and the pain is somewhat more manageble now but the sensation is still there and I don't think I'll be able to sleep. I also put some ear drops (although they are for the external ear) and I am not sure what to do next. I will probably go to the doctor first thing in the morning if the pain doesn't get better. I will keep this thread updated.

TL;DR gargled with salt water for sore throat, yawned, got salt in my middle ear and now it's been hurting for 3 hours

Update: It looks like I got otitis media. I also learned from the doctor that gargling with salt water is not a good practice. Perhaps it has just been placebo until now... I will however take this as a life sign that I should not do it anymore.",480,6/16/2018 3:18,tifu,daverave1212,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8rgcyi/tifu_by_gargling_with_saltwater_for_strep_throat/,/r/tifu/comments/8rgcyi/tifu_by_gargling_with_saltwater_for_strep_throat/,8rgcyi,"Had a mishap on a wakeboard years ago and felt a sharp pain in my ear canal. Asked that my friends take me home and they dumped me off at my cabin. I complained about still not feeling right. A girl in our crew who was a drug rep (yes, I know I was stupid to trust this person) suggested I just had swimmer's ear and suggested ear drops. I didn't have any so she held my head over my sink and poured rubbing alcohol down my ear canal. As the rubbing alcohol touched my lightly sunburned ear it felt cold... but then it felt like she'd set my head on fire.

TIFU by masterbutaning over the sink... like a rat.,"So, today I thought damn, I've masturbated in the bedroom, in the bathroom, in the laundry, on my way home from work, on my way to work, at work, in the bathroom of work, everywhere. I'm a nasty human being. Anyways, today I though I've never masterbated in the kitchen sink. I mean, it's protein right? What can go wrong? I just clean that shit up like nothing happened. Nobody will notice (shared apartment). So, I make sure nobody is home, I break out the lotion, put a hot lesbian scene and just go at it. I put my foot over the counter and just aim my sausage at the food dispenser. I mean, less clean up right? For context, my sink has a button underneath to turn on the food dispenser. It's one of the older ones so it spews a little  water while it's running. While I'm ready to take my final breaths. I'm clutching my feet in, ready for take-off. While I'm doing it my left knee actually hits the stupid button and turns on the dispenser. Now I'm busting out really hard towards the dispenser and all I hear is the mistake I just made. That is until the baby batter gets into the blades and starts ejaculating semen all over the kitchen. While I'm standing. With my pants down and my dick hard as a rock I can sense the warm liquid in my face, hands, arms. I see cum juice on my black plates but not only that it completely ruined the orgasm. Now I need to clean this covered in shame...welp!

"TIFU by visiting a local funfair, resulting in not being able to shower like a normal person for almost a year","So this TIFU happened like over a year ago, early summer ‚17. I was in a break-up then and my friends noticed I started isolating myself, as I start getting depressed in emotional situations.So as they want to help me to better cope with this situation, they invited me to the local Funfair. After some persuation, I agreed on accompanying them. When we arrived, we started doing the usual funfair stuff, riding the smaller rides and eating waffles and stuff..

My friend and I usually are like the hardcore g-force rollercoaster ride fans, we noticed a completely psychic „breakdancer“ ride, with likely double as many axis of acceleration as a „normal“ breakdancer. We instantly agreed we had to go on this ride, so we proceeded buying tickets and entering the ride.As we were hopping into 2 seats next to each other, my friend noticed a significant bundle of long, blonde human hair hanging off a screw at the headrest/cushion thing, that was definitely not there for decorative reasons. >!(WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKING THIS AS A WARNING. SPOILER: WE DIDNT).!<

We were looking forward to the ride, as we usually do, and we were super exited when it started. The first 15 seconds we were being thrown through time and space, It was awesome.Experiencing g forces of like around 3-4G peak, your head naturally is moving around a lot, so did mine.Suddenly, my right ear hit the headrest, and all of a sudden, the loud noises of the funfair went completely silent.

I instantly knew I probably just fucked my eardrum, as I recalled the feeling I had after a diving accident I had as a kid, also resulting in a ruptured eardrum.

Next 2 minutes of the ride I just tried not to puke, as I was completely distraught from the ride.

When it stopped I tried to play it cool, as my friends talked me like almost the whole day into coming with them.

When I finally came home (11pm) I just wanted to go to bed and visit the doctor the next day, but just as I layed down, blood was dripping out my ear.

I decided I would drive to the ER and have a doctor look at it. After 5 hours of waiting, when finally a doctor looked at my ear, she said „yeah, ruptured ear drum, ill just put a patch over it, it’ll heal by itself, see your ENT in 3 weeks.

3 weeks later, the ENT said it was NOT healing up, eventually I must go into surgery, but he tried another 2 patches (6 weeks) for it to heal on its own.

December 18. I finally had a tympanoplasty type I, getting 90&#37; of the [eardrum transplanted](https://imgur.com/a/UElPJgo), and a atticotrotomy (drilling out some parts of the era canal for reasons im not quite aware of)

Up to today it isn’t healed completely, but after a year of not being able to take a shower with my head under water, I can finally take a shower again like a normal person.

I sometimes have no feeling of taste in the right side of my tongue, as the nerve goes through the middle ear and somehow sometimes gets tired of doing his job, I still have a hearing loss of about 3-6db (opposing 50-60db before the surgery), but in daily life, my brain compensates quite a lot for this. I find it super fascinating that medicine can do this. replacing a physiologically functioning part so small you need to use a microscope during the surgery.

TL;DR My friends talked me into visiting the local funfair after a breakup, we got onto a super psychic breakdance-ride and I completely wasted my eardrum. Waiting over 6 months for surgery, still having difficulties with water and hearing over a year after the accident.",57,6/16/2018 12:18,tifu,TheResistance01,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8riqq3/tifu_by_visiting_a_local_funfair_resulting_in_not/,/r/tifu/comments/8riqq3/tifu_by_visiting_a_local_funfair_resulting_in_not/,8riqq3,Please tell me you held the carnies responsible and they footed the bills.

TIFU by trying to delid a cpu with a knife.,"Throwaway because  I don't want my family finding this and flipping out as they do with every injury I receive.

TL;DR below

This happened a couple of minutes ago, I was sat on my PC thinking about how cool the idea of delidding is. For those who don't know; delidding is when you take the top piece of metal off of a CPU known as an integrated heat spreader in order to upgrade the stock thermal conductive paste and thus improve temperatures, leaving you with something like [this](https://www.pcper.com/news/Processors/Aqua-Computer-and-Rockit-dont-want-you-keep-your-hat). I had a spare Pentium 4 laying around so I though why the hell not? This is where the fuckup becomes apparent, most sane people use a kit designed to delid or at least a razor, not me though, I thought it would be a great idea to use the blade on my Swiss army knife. Knowing well that these things will fold back up if you apply pressure in the wrong way I started going ham on the poor little Pentium. I didn't think anything would possible go wrong, I've had the knife for years and it's never hurt me, this of course changed when I decided I could do it quicker if I just stabbed it off instead of semi-carefully sawing at it as I had been doing for the past few minutes. As soon as I thrust forth it of course snaps back and lodges itself into my fingertip. I didn't realise what had happened straight away as the snap startled me, I mean these things aren't the sharpest in the world so I pulled at it a bit thinking it was fine then it started bleeding quite a bit. The next minute was spent staring into the mirror at myself feeling oh so disappointed at my own stupidity with my finger under the tap. It didn't look too bad as the knife went in at an angle and mostly got skin but it fuckin' hurt . Problem is, it's my index finger and now I cant even hold a pen or anything  without it hurting or getting blood on it (may have to clean my keyboard after this), and I don't want to cover it in tissues or a plaster as I actually want to be able to do my work.

TIFU by damaging my freshly washed car and my garage door,"I'm sure you can see where this is going. Being that it was a cool overcast day today, I decided to wash my car. And I gave it the works, power wash, touch wash, hand drying and hand wax. Spent two hours on it - I'm short and the car is tall, so it takes some time to do it right with a step stool. My car is looking beautiful and shiny, so it's time to put it back in the garage. This is where the fuck-up starts.

I normally park my car facing into the garage, and off to one side to have room for my SO's car. But he's out of town and I parked his car on the street to have room to manuever the power washer without smacking his car with the hoses. So I decided to treat myself to some extra room and park my car in reverse in the middle of the garage. 

As I was backing in, I heard the plastic safety latch for the automatic garage door clatter on the roof of my car. I was afraid it would scratch my car, so I tried to pull forward again, so I could park further to the side and miss that latch, but I didn't realize it had already gotten tangled in the roof rack. As I drove forward, the red plastic handle snapped in half, the metal lever with the spring to release the carriage on the door opener bent 45 degrees, and my garage door came crashing down onto the roof of my car, landing a solid dent and covering my clean car with dirt and sand. I'm an idiot.

After some wrenching on the bent lever for the carriage release, the garage door will now open automatically, but it won't drive the door back down. So that's two hours of work for a dirty, dented car and a broken garage door. I was going to hand wash the SO's car tomorrow as a surprise, but maybe I'll just take it to a car wash instead.

TL;DR Hand washed my car, then promptly dented and dirtied it and broke my garage door by being a bad driver/idiot.",8,6/16/2018 22:31,tifu,VespaOfDruidia,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8rmfx5/tifu_by_damaging_my_freshly_washed_car_and_my/,/r/tifu/comments/8rmfx5/tifu_by_damaging_my_freshly_washed_car_and_my/,8rmfx5,"Oof, be careful with the garage door, those springs can kill get a pro.

"TIFU by jumping from the deck into the pool, breaking my leg, and almost dying.","So this actually happened about 6 years ago but it’s still interesting. I was about 10 and i went out to my grandparents to go swimming. (they were pretty well off so they had a personal pool and lived in a great community) I was always a pretty stupid kid so I was generally prone to getting hurt. I wanted to show off by jumping over the railing of the deck straight into the pool. I’d done it plenty of times but my luck ran out here. I ran, jumped, and my foot caught the railing. I tripped and shattered my tibia completely. This caused some internal bleeding in my leg as the broken bits of bone sliced up the insides a bit. I was rushed to the hospital and it took an hour before i was in surgery. They said i was incredibly lucky. The bleeding could’ve killed me. They managed to fix up my leg enough to put a cast on it. I was in the hospital for a week and in casts and braces for almost a year. They say if my leg breaks again it might be permanent. I’m not sure what their reasoning was but I’m just not gonna break my leg. I also got addicted to the painkillers that the hospital prescribed me, but that’s a story for another day.

TIFU by going for a walk while having diarrhea,"This happened yesterday. I had diarrhea, but I still thought I should go for a walk with the dog. So I took some pill and assumed I would be safe.

During the walk I realised that was a mistake. The urge to poop was building up and I knew I wouldn't be able to hold it until I was home. I looked around to make sure no one was near and ran for cover in the bushes.

I dropped my pants and made it just in time. But I got noticed. By the mosquitoes. They realised I was in a vulnerable position and came after me. I tried to beat as much as possible of me while wiping my ass (I was lucky to have tissues with me).

They managed to bite me a lot. I got 12 bites on my left leg, 7 on my right leg, 5 on my left butt cheek, 2 on my right butt cheek, 2 on my lower back and 3 on my left arm. Somehow my left side seemed to be more desirable than my right side.

TIFU by summoning a Vietnamese drug lord to a lantern festival,"Inspired by the Kenyan drug lord story, here is my similar fuck up which happened last year.

A little backstory. Last May I spent a month backpacking around Vietnam with a friend as celebration for having finished first year of uni. We each bought some shitty scrap metal held together by electrical tape (known as ""motorcycles"" by the locals) and attempted to do in one month what the Americans couldn't do in years: travel from the south to the north. 

2 weeks into our trip we arrived at Hoi An, a pretty city with French architecture and Tourist prices. We had joined forces with 7 other bikepackers and, seeing as about half of us had motorcycles that ran about as smoothly as a quadriplegic horse, we decided to spend a few days in the city while our bikes got repaired. A couple days where we could truly rest and relax. As it happened, we had arrived on the night of a Lantern festival so the entire city was alive and happening. All the better.

After dinner we start exploring the city. Thousands of lanterns are floating down the river and classes of schoolkids are performing dances in the streets. Music, fresh food, great atmosphere. As it gets darker the bar scene gets bigger. A couple bottles of ""vodka"" later and we are killing it at the bar. Really having a great time. This Aussie we were with kept buying balloons of NOS, which I think is essentially laughing gas. You take one hit and it knocks you out harder than Mayweather. 30 seconds out then 30 seconds of dreamy, trippy coming to. It's probably super unhealthy, and it feels better than fucking a coconut. But you (or at least my weak-ass self) can only handle  about 2 or 3 hits before it just starts making you nauseous. So we needed something else.

So everything's going great. The 9 of us are slamming beers, huffing gas, chatting up locals, good shit. But I'm starting to feel NOSeous (ha!). I don't smoke weed but for some reason I got the grandest idea of being a gentleman and hooking up the table with some quality Vietnamese marijuana. I'm sure it's gotta be easy to find weed around here; there's tons of bars and tons of tourists. I go to the next bar over and ask the barista (B) where I can get weed. His eyes light up and he says ""wait here"". I'm thinking he'll go grab a couple joints from the back, but if you've read the other TIFU, you might be guessing that he too thought he was about to broker the sale of the century. He comes back and tells me to wait around for 45 minutes. 

5 minutes later and I forgot what I was waiting for so I wandered back to the other bar. 40 minutes later B grabs me by the wrist and leads me back to his bar. He leads me behind the counter and to the back of the bar, then opens this hidden door and tells me to go in. It leads to a tiny, dimly lit room with white tiled walls and a small folding table. These 3 Vietnamese dudes are cramped in there wearing all black and have a fucking duffle bag. B tells me these guys drove 45 minutes just to come meet me, and they're ready to do the transfer. Under normal circumstances I would have been freaking out, but these were special circumstances so I was acting extra special. 
""Yup wow....WOW! That smells like great weed I'm sure it's great yup"" or something slurred to that effect.
The dealers start talking to B in Vietnamese, probably asking who this kid is and why is he smiling like a fucking retard. B tells them its fine or something so the dealers pull out a brick of goods from the dufflebag and B tells me the price by the FUCKING POUND. I guess these guys thought I was going to drop a couple thousand bucks and walk out of the bar with a few pounds of weed stuffed down my shirt. Actually, they were  probably smarter than that, but I wasn't.
""Oh great yeah I'll just get my wallet at the bar be back in a jiffy"". B looks me in my eyes and tells me I better not make them wait. Great.

I run back to the bar. My friend is absolutely sloshed, so when I ask him to trade shirts he doesn't hesitate. Now that I have my disguise, I start running. Sprinting. Stumbling. At this point the fear is hitting me and I'm ready to run back to Canada. Instead I just run back to the hotel. 

I woke up the next morning to my friend asking why he was wearing my shirt. I was pretty rattled and cautious the next day, but no gang hitmen got me. The rest of the trip was fantastic, but I didn't try to buy weed again.

Yeah no. It just started resetting itself, I didn’t mess with it because I was afraid I’d break it or mess some important files up, so basically I just had to sit there and let my computer reset, at least I have everything I had been working on put on a USB, a few hours before.

TIFU By taking a picture in the metro,"Seoul, South Korea. 
I'm in the metro on my way for the capital. It's my last week in the country, my baggage are on my feet and I'm tired. My ride will be long, like two hours long. And I'm already bored. After watching the not-so-interesting landscape through the window, listening to the few tracks I have on my phone and smiling and noding to a few old ladies, I'm even more bored. I can't sleep because I don't have any seats. The metro is packed. I can't read either, my book is buried in my luggage. 
So I start taking selfies. 

But, let's be honest, I'm not in the most beautiful place and my face is not that interesting either. After deleting most of the shots I just took, I have finally some luck, the man next to me just stood up to leave. It's great, I think, I will be able to sleep a bit before arriving. But, of course, I can't. Too much noises, too hot... I'm back to my endless quest to fight the boredom. 

And I start again to take some pictures. At some point I notice two ladies in the seats in front of me. They wear outfits that are quite interesting. Korean style. I enjoy the way people dress here, everybody has their own style. And their outfits are very different from my home country. So I take a picture, both as a memory and as an inspiration for later. And quickly forget about it. An hour or so pass and I have to get out soon. 

Four stations before my stop, three policemen come in the car. I don't think much about it, except that they bring some novelty. I wonder why they are here. It's not usual to see policemen in the metro, at least I had never seen any until now. It takes me a few seconds to understand that I'm in trouble. They are here for me. The officer starts talking to me in a broken English. ""Phone please. Pictures, gallery. Show.""

My brain seems to simultaneously freeze and run at full speed. ""fuckfuckingshitWhatdidIdofuuuuck"" and ""I don't want to go to jail"" are looping in my head.
I'm getting scared. Oh god, why did I take this fucking shit. They look through my pictures, find easily the criminal one. Criminal because, my dumb ass forgot to cut the head of the ladies and you can clearly see their faces. And as they tell me later, if the face of someone is visible, you need their contentment to keep the pic. Of course, it's normal. But I completely forgot this basic rule.

We are now on the platform. They have taken pictures of my phones and my passport. ""Why is this picture on your phone ? Why did you take this picture ?"", ask the only one who can speak English without end. I try to explain, he doesn't understand. He ask the same questions again. This goes back and forth for a few minutes. I am terrified now. I am alone in a country really far away from home and I can't speak the native language. English seems useless. I can't believe that I was that dumb and I damn the stupid picture endlessly in my mind. Finally my interlocutors decide to use Naver to translate. I write my explanation. I hope that's acceptable. My hands are shaking. They read it and start speaking quickly in Korean for what seems to be an eternity. Passerby stops sometimes with curiosity. I am on the verge of tears. They ask me once again for my passport. Talk some more. 

Finally they look at me. ""You delete picture now. No more"". They check the name of my hostel and they give me my papers back. It's over. I'm so relieved that I cry a little bit. And keep saying sorry. Now I hope that there will be no more consequences.

TIFU by forgetting half of a script during a school performance.,"Today I will be sharing with you one of the most awkward moments of my life that makes me cringe each time I recollect it. While this story isn't recent by any means, I thought it would be interesting to share with you all today.

So about 4 years ago, my Drama Teacher had planned for my class to do an act based on WW1 soldiers that was a part of our list of performances for the year. Each student in the class was given different roles, some minor and some larger. As we were sitting in our circular set of chairs, I was selected the role of ""The Doctor"", which was a pretty major role revolved around the main story. Since I can't exactly remember the main concept of what this play was, I'll summarise it as a soldier who needed surgery in order to look normal in society. 

We had a couple of months to learn these lines, which gave us plenty of time to revise. During those months, I never took this performance as a priority over my other subjects, so revision of the script was very minimal. I thought everything would be fine if I read it constantly over the final week, but boy was I wrong. Unbeknownst to me, it turned out that the entire school would be watching this live. In previous acts, we usually just performed for a certain year group consisting of a small number of students, but this time would be different. All my friends, teachers and other students would be there including the Headmaster (Who we shall call Mr K for now). 

I reassured myself that everything would be fine on that fateful day, bringing the script along with me just so I could refresh myself on what lines I had to say. When we dressed in costume and finalised our appearances, it was time to perform! Everyone was roaring to go, while I simply stood in the corner as a nervous wreck. Let's just say a lack of confidence during a live performance in front of all your friends is a sign for disaster. 

When it was finally my time to go on stage, I felt semi-assured as everything flowed smoothly. I said my lines and the conversation flowed naturally. All went well until I the lead actor spoke a line which I forgot the response to. For five minutes, I stood there frozen. I expected some sort of prompt to help me forward in the performance, but nothing of the sort came. Everyone in the audience stared at me, along with the actors on stage. At this point, I was shitting bricks. The school watched quietly and I could see Mr K at the front giving off a glare like he was about to strangle me once this thing was over. I specifically remember my Drama Teacher saying ""Oh shit"" off-stage as I stood dormant for what felt like an hour. 

Finally, a line came back into my head and I imediatly spoke it just to progress the show. As it turns out, this specific line was located near the end of the script, meaning I just skipped half of the damn script for this extremally long scene. Due to this scene being the longest and most vital moments of the show, it caused the entire performance to not make any sense by the end. This made the play end much sooner than anticipated, thus resulting a later applause from the audience that made me want to dig my own grave. 

After that eventful day, I showed up to Drama Class feeling like a complete doofus. I remember one of my classmates saying, 

""Everything went pretty well, except for (insert my name)"". 

TL;DR: TIFU by not revising lines and leaving it to the last week. As a result, I ended up missing half of the script during a vital scene in front of the whole school, leaving me in complete embarrassment.

TIFU by breaking my right hand for doing badly on a final exam,"Disclaimer: this happened yesterday, but I couldn't write it post surgery since I was asleep. I'm writing this on my phone with my left hand.

To set the context, I just finished 11th grade and you have to know that I'm a very competitive guy and I have very high expectations for myself, so doing well in school is really important to me.

Anyways the past week has been finals week, with a test or two per day. The scores we get on these tests are used by teachers to predict our scores for our transcript that we apply to universities with. Yesterday (Friday) I had my last test - higher level mathematics - and although I felt good about it, I talked to my classmates about it and realized I'd completely f'd it up. I want to study computer science in University, so my math score is extremely important, so this really frustrated me. I was basically furious with myself.

When I went home, angry and disappointed, my mum was extremely upbeat and kept telling me about her day even though I'd told her I was really upset about the test and wanted to be left alone. I was completely overreacting, but I shouted at her to leave and she got offended.

Upon realizing I had offended her due to my own inability to control my emotions, ironically, I hated myself even more and I smashed my right hand against our couch, not considering I was hitting the armrest, which is solid wood. 

It hurt a lot so I looked at my hand, and there was a large lump protruding  from the top and when I saw that the joint behind my pinkie was displaced, I fainted onto the couch. I screamed for my mom to take me to the hospital.

I had X-Rays taken and it was clear one of the bones was bent in the middle so as to be sticking out. Doctors said surgery was necessary and that it would take at least 2 months to recover. 

So here I am, still in the hospital, dreading my impulsivity and stupidity, thinking of how I've crippled myself for the dumbest of reasons.

I won't be able to write all my summer essays and school projects I still have left. I won't be able to swim at the beach. I won't be able to train properly in the gym. I won't be able to code properly, being the one handed man I am now.  I also won't be able to properly function at my internship...

My only hope is getting Deadpool powers through some miracle, but the wires sticking out of my hand to keep the bones in place say otherwise.

TLDR: Did badly on a final exam and felt like a dipshit for insulting my mom. Out of self loathing I slammed my fist again the couch, not considering the result of slamming bone against hard wood. Now I have my right hand in a cast for minimum 2 months and my summer plans are down the drain.",15,6/16/2018 9:06,tifu,nikgeo25,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8ri0s6/tifu_by_breaking_my_right_hand_for_doing_badly_on/,/r/tifu/comments/8ri0s6/tifu_by_breaking_my_right_hand_for_doing_badly_on/,8ri0s6,"Wow!

TIFU by letting my son crawl up the stairs at bedtime,"This happened just a couple of hours ago... A true Today I Fucked Up. Truth be told this is really my wife's Fuck Up.


My young son has gotten pretty good on his feet and is lightning fast crawling. We went through the bedtime routine. When I picked up his blanket he just headed for the stairs. He knew what was going down and he was fine with it because he was just plumb tired. He made it to the stairs on his feet and went to crawling when he got to the first step and I just let him head upstairs where him and Sister share and enormous bedroom. I made my way up the stairwell hot on his heels and as we got upstairs he made a run for Sisters bed. Which worked out well(or so I thought) so I had a second to get his blanket and cup situated in his crib.
Blanket in place and crib ready to go I spin around to head for the other side of the room to grab Little Brother. As I spin to the right a very pungent odor grabs the attention of my nostrils and my tired eyes focus in on my little boy elbow deep in shit! Oh noooooo! As I run to grab him thinking that maybe he'd had a major blowout of a Pamper it did slightly occur to me that smell is just off. Something is wrong here besides my kid covered in poo. 
Back down the stairs and straight into the bathtub with the boy, shorts off, diaper off, and no shat.... Not even a shart!!! WTF??? 

My mind races back to when I got home from work and come to think of it, the porch door was closed. The back porch is where the cat's litter box, food bowl, and water is at... Ohhhhhh good grief. The boy is covered in CAT SHIT!!! My wife works 2nd shift, but today she went in at 9:30 this morning. I got home at 3:30. So all day the cat has been trapped in the house without access to his litter box or his food and water. I mean he had to shit somewhere. I can't really be mad at him... Scrubbing cat crap from my son and having to scrape it from Sisters sheets before going into the washer is not really how I wanted to start my fathers day weekend.

TLDR: Let my kid crawl up the stairs on the way to bed for the night where he found a pile of cat shit to play in on his sisters bed.

TIFU by reading too much Reddit,"Obligatory: Not today but yesterday.  

So yesterday I had 2 final exams for English and Algebra 2, each counting for a fifth of my overall yearly grade for their respective courses. Now I am Muslim and it's Ramadan so I was up till midnight praying at the mosque. The thing is, I'm fasting too so I gotta wake up at 3am to eat. Me, being the smartass I am, knowing I need all the energy I can get for the exams, decide not to sleep for the 3  hours in between in order to make sure I wake don't miss breakfast (FU#1). So I just chill on my phone, playing games until 3am where I wake up the family and we eat. Now an hour later when it's 4, everyone is going back to sleep. On the other hand, me, an intellectual decides I'm not tired yet so that means I should do just a bit more Reddit (the real big FU). I end up finding an askreddit post about the most legendary threads of all time (you may have seen it). This ends up being a huge mistake as I end up spending almost an hour and a half reading through all those threads. Before I know it it's 5:24am. The horror of looking at the time and seeing led me to remember it so well. The English exam starts at 7:30 and the algebra one starts at noon, each lasting 3 hours. Me, knowing how fucked I am, type a comment on that thread telling them how fucked I am and I go to sleep. 

I wake up and its 7:30. I slept for 2 hours and have 6 hours worth of exams that day. Me, not knowing when the test starts, thinks it's at 8. My mom checks and it's at 7:30. I don't even get ready, I just get my sandals and straight out the door with just a pen forgetting my calculator (FU#3). I go to school and the English 10 test just started. I hand over my phone and start. We got 15 MC questions (15%), a short response (21%) and an essay (64%). I am extremely sleepy. I force myself to at least finish the MC before falling asleep. I sleep for at least half an hour and I wake up to find I'm an hour into the test with only 15% of the point value completed. I start rushing through the short response which takes me over an hour as I'm still tired. I finish it and I got 3 passages to read and an essay on them. After reading them I got half an hour to write an essay worth 64% of the test. Needless to say, I didn't finish it and only got about 2/3 of it done. During the last 15 minutes I was completely alone in the big gym, trying to finish my test after everyone left. 

After finishing it, I noticed I didn't have my calculator and I had about 45 minutes before the next test. I called my mother and she said she would drop off my sister with my calculator. The problem was, she only dropped her off a few minutes before noon. Her phone was lost/stolen a few days ago so she couldn't find me even though I was in the lobby right in front of the main doors. I eventually have up and entered the test like 5 minutes late and had to borrow a school calculator which was at least 2 decades of technology behind the one I and everyone else was used to. I spent at least 15 minutes on either the last or second to last MC question which had log base because ethis calculator couldn't do that. I got stuck on many simple questions due to the calculator and ended up guessing a bunch of MC and missing the last 5 or so questions. And that's considering the most valuable questions are at the end. 

Needless to say I FU real bad and although I most likely didn't fail algebra, I passed English with a 65 the last 2 quarters and that test could possibly land me in summer school. 

TL;DR Was dumbass and read Reddit till 5am the day I had 2 final exams, probably landed in summer school for English

TIFU by getting poison ivy on my man-parts,"Mandatory ""not today"", but I'm still suffering from the consequences of my FU.

My neighbor, we'll call him Steve, has a house across the street, but spends the majority of his time working out-of-state. Being the business venturer that I am, I mow his lawn once a week for extra cash. Steve's upkeep (or the lack thereof) of the hedgerow has made this task quite a bit more dangerous, so I decide to hack down some of the more pesky branches. I spotted some shiny leaves that my brother, who was helping with the task, said could be poison. I rushed home immediately and rinsed off with dish soap to get rid of any of the plant's oil.

Here's where I made my gargantuan mistake with the ol' family jewels. I used a loofah with dawn to scrub my arms and legs. Being that I was already in the shower, I figured I'd rinse off the grime from my day, doing so without first thoroughly scrubbing my hands. I do the ol', armpits, genitalia, butt-scrub routine. Fast-forward to yesterday morning, when I noticed my plums were a little more itchy than normal.

I almost immediately knew what happened, but alas, it was too late; the damage was done.

I'm currently in bed, with an ice pack between my legs and an extremely itchy body. I asked to leave work early today, as I couldn't take the itch any longer, and I drove home with my pants at my knees to reduce friction. I will no longer be mowing Steve's lawn.

TL;DR - I tried to make $ mowing my neighbors lawn.

TIFU by unintentionally insulting a vendor,"TLDR at the bottom 

 It’s nothing major but it’s been really bothering my conscience ever since it happened and I just need to get it out of my chest. I was at an electronic music festival, and by culture, was rolling BALLS on MDMA. A couple of friends and I took a break from the stage by walking towards where they have tents selling merchandise from local companies and private ones such as clothes, accessories, etc. We passed by a tent where this man was selling hand crafted metal art decor, ones where you can hang on the ceiling or stick on your wall. They were really cool, with a variety of different designs such as one he made with the festival logo, a Phoenix looking one and other intricate designs with different colours. We took a minute and looked at his stuff, I picked up an item and i asked “what am i supposed to do with this?”. Some of you may think what the hell i did wrong, but its the way I asked him and the look on my face that made it look like I was belittling and insulting his art, art that he took time to craft out of his own hands and sweat. He looked really disappointed with my response and he says “you put them on your wall” And stares at me for a couple more seconds as if he couldn’t believe what I said. We walk away and my friend who’s in art school says “what you said man wasn’t cool”. I realized that the second i said it. I really didn’t mean it that way lol and i sure felt bad the whole night and kinda ruined my trip. Idk if it has anything to do with the M but man i really did feel bad D: 

TLDR; was high on MDMA at an EDM music fest, basically said to an art vendor “what are you selling and what am I supposed to do with this?” unintentionally insulting his art, probably due to being high on M, felt bad as shit afterwards.

TIFU by ruining my credibility with my schools staff the day after graduating,"Actual TIFU. Save me from my guilt. But also don't give this too much traction I really don't need people recognizing I posted this here.

My highschool career already wasn't something to be proud of but it wasn't really anything more noticeable than a severe slacker with a sociable personality, at least it wasn't until today. I have my ups and my downs, I've taken 7 of our AP classes and failed one semester of a regular class but made it up successfully. I made it out the door in flames, I think I had a D and a C- among A's and B's for just total neglect, but regardless, I was supposed to be graduating no questions asked.

I was emailed by my counselor about 6 weeks out from graduation about an online PE class I had enrolled in because I had forgotten to taken a single semester of it.

Fuck.

Out of sheer anxiety I just didn't do it, with the alibi of another enrolled student I managed to fend off the said counselor because (to some truth) the system on their side was not properly updating with the progress some students were making. By the time graduation rolled around, she had asked me for screenshots from my computer of the progress I had so she could give me the credit for the course.

Of course, since I hadn't done anything, through the power of inspect element and a 7 day trial of adobe photoshop I apparently created some very convincing screenshots because when I was confronted with it they asked ""Which student took pictures of their progress for you"".

I was supposed to be leaving the country on the 8th of July to go semi-move in with my girlfriend and her family (it's complicated) else I would be kicked out or live in neglect much longer here, so something like summer school wasn't an option for me to complete the class, so I felt justified in just trying to get the fuck out of here by pulling a fast one.

Slowly I watched my counselor threading more and more people into that little CC box on the emails as she was trying to pull strings together to get me to complete the course (god bless her, what a saint) which inevitably meant this message of me essentially committing fraud shot around the rest of the counselors and administrators.

I still don't know entirely what the fuck is going on because on Thursday I was told one plan to finish the course but today when I came in I was called down and told another plan that was slightly more lenient, and this same kind woman told me to ""try and avoid his line of sight if you can when you're coming in here"" so... yeah.

The worst part about it is I had been in working on it today and over the course of about 2 and a half hours I am 93&#37; done already. This whole thing could have been avoided if I had literally filled the coursework out instead of installing, learning photoshop, and waiting in panic for emails.

**TL;DR:** Attempted to (impressively) photoshop my coursework to send to a counsellor for my last highschool credit for maybe 3-4 hours of work.

Here is a few pointers to help achieve that status.


-COMMUNICATE. You married this person. You live with this person. If you don't talk about what is annoying you, or how you are feeling you are going to have an argument at some point bigger than it needs to be. Instead of replying to ""are you ok?"" or ""whats wrong?"" with ""nothing, I'm fine"" when you are clearly not fine, tell your SO that you are annoyed or angry and in a sulking mood and tell them why. It will either explain it and they understand OR you have a smaller argument that can be resolved simply.



-TRUST. I think snooping through someones phone is a breach of trust and looking for trouble. That being said, if you are scared of what your partner may find on your phone, you're not husbanding or wifing correctly.

-NEVER go to bed angry. Please do your best to sort out any squabbles you have had before bedtime. The bedroom should be a safe place. Safe place activities include TV, Netflix, fucking and sleeping. Not arguing. For any assistance please refer to above COMMUNICATION section.



-SPACE. While you do love your husband or wife (probably) it is very important to have some ""Me time"" You need to both have your own hobby(s) which you are free to do on your own or with your own friends. You don't have to be 24/7 in each others pocket. Do not complain about your husband or wife doing (insert wholesome hobby here) once a week/month or what ever it is. 



-Teamwork. You two are married. You are now the #1 family in your eyes. Not you and your mother/father. Or them and their family. It's you two.. one team one dream. Your SO and yourself are the priority. Of course you still can love your parents, and yes you still should take other peoples advice on board. If family or friends are constantly talking shit about your SO, remember that you married them. You do not have to blindly just agree with what they say to avoid conflict. You love them. Stand up for them.


-BE TOGETHER. Enjoy yourselves. Have fun together, you are friends AND family all in one. Do nice things for no reason occasionally. 


-COMPROMISE. You don't have to win every argument. Believe it or not, someone may be justified in what they are thinking that might not be you. Listen and remove your own emotion and try to understand how they may feel about the situation. You need to give sometimes, and take sometimes.



-SEXY TIME. Part of every healthy marriage (only when done with SO)


-Good luck and happy marriage. ",CA[deleted],9,34:26.3

TIFU by remote broadcasting porn on the family TV while my family was watching,"Obligatory, it was today. So it’s World Cup season which for my family is a signal to stop everything and glue itself to the TV for a month, yelling and screaming and arguing over calls. It was halftime in the Peru/Denmark game and everyone headed for the restrooms then kitchen to get snacks. I headed upstairs to my room for a few minutes. 

I checked a few things online and then thought, ‘I’ve got time, I’ll take care of business real quick.’ I have a Samsung laptop and tv. I’ve got it set up to mirror from the laptop to the tv. I close the door and pull up a certain website ‘hub’ and try to mirror. Not working. Leave the video running and try to troubleshoot. 

“What’s going on with the tv?!?” I hear from downstairs. “What is this?!? Close your eyes [dad]!!”

Panic. I used my computer with the downstairs tv for some games this week while everyone was gone to work and I was home sick. I hit pause. Lot of f-ing good that does. (More yelling from downstairs, ‘turn that off!’) Now there’s a guy frozen mid thrust. Close the screen. Great. My background pops up. It’s a picture of our family. Shit. 

I go through the process of closing down screen share and finally succeed. Downstairs has gotten really quiet. “[My name]? Can you come down here? 

The next hour was incredibly painful and not because my team lost the game. I’ve had my tv and my computer confiscated and have to use my phone under restrictions.

TIFU by cracking a kids heads open.,"Nope, wasn't today.

Several years back, when I was in elementary school, I was at our park right behind the school. I was joined by my sister. We went straight to the merry-go-round. 

Not the carnival ones with the horses. The flat multicolored ones. 

Anyway, she hops on and I start spinning. I feel a little resistance and a thunk.

Stupid childlike me didn't understand and ignored it. Not caring what it could be. I spun harder to force it against the resistance.

That's when the crying started. 

I was confused. A kid came crawling out from underneath the merry-go-round with blood running down his face. His mother ran up comforting him. I sincerely apologised to her and said I didn't know he was under there. The mother seemed to understand and told me it's okay.

I fucking left. I didn't know if I should stay but in my child like mind I figured she wouldn't want the kid who cracked her kids skull open to stand there watching.

TIFU by wiring an outlet incorrectly,"Well, in true TIFU, it actually happened 3 months ago. But I just found out about it today. So in March, I wired a new outlet in my basement for a freezer. Today I go down to my basement and discover this smell. Horrid smell. The worst smell I've ever smelled. And I don't hear the freezer. So I go check, and nope it isn't working. And it hasn't been for a few days at least. EVERYTHING in there is defrosted and rotten. Dozens of pounds of pork, chicken, steak, fish, turkey, ground beef. And worse than that, leftover stew and soup and cake. But the smell. My Lord the smell was terrible. I drag it outside and drain it and start cleaning it out. I almost threw up a few times. Now I have to figure out how to get the smell out of the basement, and my house, and my hands, and my head. I'm not even sure if I still smell it or if it is just in my head still. Oh, and I feel like I need to leave a note and a tip for my garbage men when they pick up the trash on Wednesday.

TIFU by making people think I might kill myself,"I won't go into too much detail of it, but I have some old self harm scars on my arms from long ago. I haven't cut myself ever since and I thought my arms had healed nicely. They were barely visible and I didn't think anybody would notice so I regularly wore short sleeves. I hid them so well while they healed that my own parents never even found out about it. Nobody had said a thing until today...

I'm a nursing student on my clinical placement. I thought it would another normal day at the hospital until my supervisor pulled me aside and asked if she could speak to me privately. She pointed at my arm  and asked if I was okay and if there was anything I needed. She went on a long speech about the importance of mental health and how stressful things were for people these days, before finally mentioning the school asked to check up on all the students because earlier that week another student (I had no idea this happened) had committed suicide. I was pretty shocked. I insisted I was fine but I was really nervous because I was hoping nobody would ever find out I cut myself in the past. I was pretty embarrassed and I didn't say anything about the scars other than stating that I was okay.  I feel like shit after hearing what happened and I even feel shittier now that my past might be out.

tl;dr: Somebody in my program killed themselves, lots of concern got around the community and somebody noticed my self harm cuts and got worried I was in danger of killing myself. Now I just might end up on suicidewatch.",6,6/17/2018 2:01,tifu,ApprehensiveCancel,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8rnnz7/tifu_by_making_people_think_i_might_kill_myself/,/r/tifu/comments/8rnnz7/tifu_by_making_people_think_i_might_kill_myself/,8rnnz7,I'd rather they check on a hundred people that don't need it if it meant they found just one that did.

TIFU by almost killing someone at the beach,"All of this happened when I was on vacation in Hawaii on a trip that my mom won through doing online sweepstakes when I was 14 years old (now 23). 

On this vacation I was beginning to get a bit bored of going to the beach every day to watch my parents sun themselves and read. I had recently learned how to skip stones on the beach back home which is often fairly deserted so there wasn't much danger of hitting people. My budding young adolescent mind thought it would be fine to skip rocks on a fairly crowded beach since I already had some experience with skipping rocks before and surely I could throw straight. Boy was I wrong. 

I went along with skipping some rocks and it was working alright despite some waves interrupting my skipping. That is, until I released one too late and it skipped right into a dinky raft, like the inflatable Wal-Mart ones, that was conveniently pushed by a wave right into the path of my rock. It hit one of the two people in the raft and I was mortified, but I knew that I really can't throw them that hard and it was a small rock so I waved them sorry and ran away back to where my parents were sunning themselves a little ways away.

I had mostly forgotten about the issue and started earing my packed lunch when the ladies came up and confronted my parents starting with ""You know your son almost killed me"". Turns out that one of the ladies, the one that I had hit had just underwent heart surgery and if she had fallen in the water, there's a good chance she would have died from complications of sudden exposure to cold water.

I got scolded by my parents pretty harshly and was told not to skip rocks any more on the ocean, but the same thing crossed their mind that crossed mine, ""If you were going to die if you fell in the water, why were you in a dinky inflatable raft on the wavy ocean to begin with?""

It still kinda haunts me to this day but it's rather rare is comes up actively in my thoughts, another TIFU just jogged my memory on this so I figured I would share.

TL;DR I was skipping rocks in the ocean and hit a woman who was recovering from heart surgery.

TIFU by probably destroying some kids face with a chain.,"Obligatory this didn't happen today. It happened about 10 or 11 years ago. So, a little background first. I lived with my father in a small, shitty apartment in the back roads of Georgia, and the apartments were nestled right next to some schmoozy fancy neighbourhood, the kids of which treated us kids at the apartments like lower class people. There was a chain link fence behind the apartment that led right into the backyard of one kid, and most of us apartment kids used that to get into the neighbourhood to play and stuff. Well one day I ran into the kid who lived at that house, a Mexican kid about my age. He wasn't a dick like the rest of the kids, and we actually started to become friends. Fast forward a week or so and we were puttering around his backyard, looming for something to do. Somehow I uncovered a chain buried in the dirt and together we dug it up and cleaned it off. Then, to my eternal regret, I had an idea. ""Hey,"" I said, ""let's play Ghost Rider!"" The premise of the ""game"" was to swing the chain around your head then swing towards the others legs, wrapping around it and pulling. He agreed, and we played around for a few. Then, when it was my turn I was swinging around and around and went towards him, he fell. He fell to his knees, and I didn't have time to correct the chains path. The chain hit him in the side of the head, then centrifugal force snapped the rest of the chain back around to his face, effectively whipping his face. He dropped screaming, and I am ashamed to say I ran like hell. I ran all the way home, crying my eyes out, and hid in my room for the rest of the day. I saw him again, later, and his face was covered in bandages. I never went through his backyard again.

Tl;dr: I tried swinging a chain at a kid I knew and ended up hitting him in the face instead of the legs.",2,6/17/2018 3:24,tifu,whatifcatsare,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8ro42v/tifu_by_probably_destroying_some_kids_face_with_a/,/r/tifu/comments/8ro42v/tifu_by_probably_destroying_some_kids_face_with_a/,8ro42v,😬😬😬😬,CA[deleted],1,35:02.3

Tifu By Giving Myself A Permanent Finger scar,"This actually happened a few years ago and I'm still disappointed in myself.

I was sitting in class and the teacher gave us a piece of paper that we needed to hold onto. The paper had no holes so I grabbed the hole puncher and attempted to hole punch my paper. The hole puncher was broken and being the genius that I am, I decided to use a pair of scissors instead. At first, I gently tried to nip the paper with the scissors as I could then expand the hole with my fingers. As this failed to work, I became frustrated and held the   paper in one hand while stabbing straight down through the paper with the scissors as hard as I could. The good news is I made a hole in the paper, the bad news is that the scissors also went straight through my finger and now blood was gushing everywhere. I then made my second mistake, instead of going for stitches, I figured that the 'small cut' would heal by itself. My finger swelled several times in size and when the swelling died down, an ugly gash was left of the side of my finger where the scissors went through. I still have that scar today, 6 years later.

TL;DR
I used scissors instead of a hole puncher, stabbed myself, didn't get stitches, I have a permanent scar.",1,6/17/2018 4:32,tifu,Predator6578,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8roh57/tifu_by_giving_myself_a_permanent_finger_scar/,/r/tifu/comments/8roh57/tifu_by_giving_myself_a_permanent_finger_scar/,8roh57,CB[deleted],CA[deleted],CS[deleted],37:14.2

TIFU by Trying to Walk Down a Hill and Breaking My Bitchass Bones,"Am currently on a trip to Ruidoso, NM and my family decided to go ziplining and paddle boating at Inn of the Mountain Gods because why not? By the time we get there, which is around two o'clock, it had rained for a good while and now just cleared up enough to do the aforementioned activities.

Now, I'm really fucking excited to zipline over the lake they have and see the Teepees they have decorating the sides of the lake, so like a goddamn idiot, I hurry down the hill from the parking lot which leads to the coast of the lake.

Well, here's where things go really fucking wrong.

I slip on the mud and go down right away, I hear two distinct snaps as I hit the ground. Boom. Immediate pain and my face planted in the mud. After a while of trying to crawl my way to a bench (where my family helps me hobble onto), security comes and helps take me back to the car. Now, this is alright despite the fact I'm in agony. We go on our way to the ER and I'm admitted into the emergency room. I get my Xrays and a splint (I cried through it because it hurt so badly), have a little chat with my new ER buddy (an adorable little girl who was shot in the knee with a .22, she gave me a lot of perspective about my current situation so that was nice), and soon got told I broke my fucking  bitchass tibia and fractured my ankle.

Fine. Well, after signing a shit ton of papers and getting some crutches, I make it back to the car and to the hotel...Where I promptly realize I have no fucking idea where my phone is and my left shoe is missing as well. So now I am a shoe-less, phone-less invalid for the whole summer.

TIFU by not vacuuming my carpets.,"Two weeks ago, I found a dog on the side of the road and decided to bring him in for the night. He was really gross and he had so many fleas on him. I washed him and I kept him for a few days. He was a very sweet dog. I posted him online and found his original owners! I thought it was the end of it. 

That’s the only good part of the story. 

I was watching my girlfriends cats. Both of them don’t like me. She went on a trip with her family.

After giving the dog to the owners, I noticed her cats started scratching themselves and I thought nothing of it. 

A week passes and I started to notice specks of blood in my bathroom. It wasn’t too bad at first. I didn’t think anything of it. 

Two days pass and the situation got worse. Blood was everywhere in the bathroom. I looked at her cats and there was around 10 fleas on each. I bought them flea medicine. It was around $30. I thought this would fix the situation. 

Two more days and I started to notice what seemed like salt everywhere. Like my stupid self, I thought nothing of it. 

The next day I woke up and there was salt EVERYWHERE. It was a thick layer on my desk and on my cabinet.  I told my girlfriend and she told me they were flea eggs. I did not believe this at all. I got a Clorox wipe and wiped up the salt and the Clorox wipe became bloody and black. I freaked out. I cleaned all my counters and washed all my sheets. I examined both my cats and they had 80 fleas on them. I took them to Pet Smart and spent around 100 on them. 

I thought I fixed everything. 

My girlfriend got back yesterday and looked at her cats. She washed them and put the cats at her place. I researched how to get rid of fleas and it said to make sure to clean the carpets. 

I didn’t own a vacuum so I went to the store and bought one. I started the vacuum and went over a tiny corner in my room. I saw hundreds of fleas jump out of my carpets. 

This scared the shit out of me. I stopped vacuuming. I just left my apartment. I’m at my girlfriends place right now. 

I have already spent $300+ and now my place is infested with fleas. I should have researched and vacuumed before I got them washed. My apartment is screwed. 

TL;DR I brought a dog in off the streets and it infested my girlfriends cats with fleas and now my place is infested.

TIFU by studying just a bit too efficiently.,"TIFU by tirelessly sticking with my study plan. Got off to somewhat of a rocky start on my California Bar Prep course, so I figured if I could stay focused and eliminate any distractions, it would take about 5 days of studying like a champ (12 hrs/day) to catch up.

Well it’s 60 hours later and I’m all caught up. Wake up, brush my teeth, look in the mirror and think “who’s the fuckin’ champ?” Let’s see, I have exactly 38 days left until exam day. Wow, seems like only yesterday champ had 45 days left…

“Just keep your eye on the ball,” I thought, so I did. And like Harry Potter catching the Golden Snitch, I nailed my practice exams. But then I remembered something - Quidditch has more than one ball, right? Before I could even conjure a new thought, that other ball hit me square in the face – didn’t even see it coming. I looked down, and there was the ball with today’s date written in bold: **June 16th**.

I was so effective at eliminating distractions, I forgot about one minor distraction – filing my application to take the bar exam.  Final deadline: **June 15th.**

Way to keep your eye on the wrong ball, champ.

TL;DR: Found out what it feels like to pour 100&#37; of myself into studying for an exam (the passage of which my livelihood depends on) only to fuck up the easiest part - filling out a form and mailing it in with a check.

TIFU by being an office worker that doesn’t keep active,"TL;DR: Nearly die from being a lazy guy that sits down for more than 2/3 of the day, causing blood clots and pulmonary embolism 

Obligatory *this didn’t happen today* but back in 2012. 

When I was 22 I had landed myself a pretty decent job working for a commission sales role. The basic was well over minimum wage and the commission was uncapped so I would get to work, sit at my desk and work my ass off to call as many customers and suppliers to get the best product/services over to my biggest paying customers to earn as much as I possibly could.  

The job became like my addiction. I would sit at my desk from 8:30am til 6pm only getting up to pee if I absolutely had to and I ate my lunch while working. 

So before I started this job, I was and still am, your average gamer and  programmer hobbyist which roughly translates to “I spend a hell of a lot of time sitting down”. And these days I wasn’t really your active gym kind of guy and I was easily 50lbs over weight. 

I have sat in front of my PC for more hours a day since I was 13 than I care to admit. 

Anyway, back to 2012, 22 year old, 50lb overweight me: I woke up on the morning before work one day and my calf was cramping like crazy. I stumbled out into the bathroom and ran the faucet directly into my mouth as I thought I was dehydrated. 

My leg was very tender and walking was getting more and more unbearable, but I didn’t take time off work, I had money to make! 

My calf was probably in pain for a maximum of 2 weeks when one day I woke up and... it had gone. Wonderful! Must have pulled a muscle! 

Fast forward another 2 weeks and I am due to go to a conference for work at 5am. It’s about 2:30am when I am rudely awoken by what felt like somebody stabbing me in the lungs with an icicle. The pain was unbearable. My left lung was extremely sensitive just to breathe lightly. I don’t know how I managed to do it, but I call an ambulance while unable to breathe or speak loudly. I just said (from what I remember) “chest. Heart. Can’t breathe” or words to that effect. 

So, I use all my energy to get out of bed and sit on the sofa waiting for the ambulance. Two paramedics come in and immediately hook me up to heart monitors, take my blood pressure, ask me if I’ve taken any medications or had any illnesses recently etc. I tell them “no, only painkillers recently to reduce the pain in my calf”. One of the paramedics asks me which leg and I tell him the left. He immediately inspects my leg and how tight it is (as in the skin, not that he admires my leg) - then just says “we need to get you to the hospital immediately”. 

At the hospital I’m still not being told what’s going on, I have blood work done, 12 samples of blood taken from me. I have blood gasses done which is where they pierce the artery in your wrist with a syringe with no plunger (the pressure from the artery fills it up). I am then taken into the MRI room where I’m injected with UV dye to check my circulation. I’m then sent to the ultrasound room where they ultrasound my calf which doesn’t sound bad, but it was so tender that even touching it was agonising, let alone pushing a blunt object into it. 

A few hours later, a doctor comes to my hospital bed to inform me that my lifestyle of consistently sitting has caused Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT/blood clot) in my calf which I left untreated. Part of the blood clot had dislodged on its own which is when the pain in the leg would have started to subside - the dislodged clot had traveled through my veins and into my left lung, causing a Pulmonary Embolism (PE/clot of the lung). 

The clot really could have gone wherever it liked. It could have easily gone to my heart where I would have surely died in my sleep after suffering a heart attack/stroke or it could have gone to my brain which sounds equally as bleak. 

Anybody who sits down all day for a job and sits down a lot of the day when they’re home; please stay hydrated, stretch your lefts every hour or so for 10 minutes, exercise regularly and don’t let sitting down kill you. I would take an hour workout 4 days a week any time compared to injecting my stomach with clexane blood thinners and eating rat poison to thin my blood (warfarin) for 18 months.

TIFU by ruining my chances with my crush.,"This happened a couple of days ago. Dealing with the consequences still. 

Little back story. Met this girl like a month ago, I immediately started crushing on her. She’s gorgeous, funny, likes the same music as me, she’s confident, and very down to earth. (Let me stop gawking) One of my friends, who I think is much better looking than me, tried to woo her, she wasn’t having it. Eventually he got drunk and passed out. By some miracle of god, i started talking to her and we hit it off. Talking about music, and festivals we’d been to. She had to leave that night but I got her Snapchat. (Don’t have a phone service in the country I’m in currently.) 

Fast forward to a few weeks later. She messages me randomly, asking me what I’m up to, we make plans to hang out. So the weekend comes, Friday morning I go to a brunch spend all day there and in the pool/ocean. That night I ask her to come over. She’s all for it. She tells me she’s bringing a friend so I brought my buddy too. We’re hanging out all night, playing cards and drinking. At like 4:30 am, me being the idiot guy I am, for some reason convinced myself that she wasn’t really into me, she was probably just playing the whole “hard to get” thing and I just failed to realize it. So I just kind of give up and leave her alone but still be friendly. I’m just thinking, she’s not into me and I don’t wanna force myself on her and be creepy. So I’m just relaxing. Now she gets up off the couch and is in the kitchen grabbing something to drink. Now her friend comes and sits next to me and starts telling me how handsome I am and literally out of no where just plants a kiss on me. I did not kiss her back but I started being flirty with her and she saw this and got really really upset. I instantly knew I had dun fucked up. She calls her friend and they go to the restroom and my buddies are telling me I need to go talk to her and apologize. So I tried. She was really upset. Like she started getting nauseous from it. I felt so bad, and her friend has no idea why she’s upset and I’m pissed at her and myself at this point. My crush goes to the elevator as I’m trying to apologize and she’s just telling me that she doesn’t want to talk to me right now. She proceeds to go downstairs. I don’t follow her as I understand boundaries. I go back in the flat and her friend finally understands after my buddies explain what’s going on. She tells me to go follow her and try to apologize still. Me in my drunk and being a male stupidity listen and go find her. She’s kind of crying at this point and that’s when it finally hit me that she actually likes my big ugly dumbass. I’m just staying kind of far and I’m apologizing, telling her how much I like her, and how much of an idiot I am. She tells me she understands but that she doesn’t wanna talk about it. Her friend comes downstairs and they proceed to leave. Fast forward some hours so like 8 am. I’m still awake and I message her and let her reiterate my regret. She messages me later in the day and tells me it’s okay and that she just got really sick and that’s why she was upset. I know this is a lie. Now I’m pretty sure I ruined any chance I had with her and I feel like a complete piece of shit for it. She called me “Bro” in the last message she sent me. I’m pretty sure that’s the sign to stop. So I’m gonna pray she gives me another chance. But i don’t think I can do any more than that. So yeah. I’m an idiot and a piece of shit. Thanks for reading. 

Tldr; I liked a girl. Had a chance with her. Blew it by flirting with her friend. I hate myself.

TIFU by lighting my hand and nearly head on fire.,"It’s me, ya boi, with his major asthma issues.

TLDR at the bottom.

Mandatory ‘This didn’t happen today’. It was about four years ago now.

It was the beginning of spring. The birds were chirping, the sun was shining, and the flowers were blooming. To many, spring is a lovely time. However, I have some wonderful allergies to some living things such as grass and flowers, I much prefer a time where they are covered under a blanket of snowy protection to save me from the evil pollen they possess. 

Try as I may, pollen always gets into my house, which sets off my asthma, which makes my lungs fail at the one job they have. However, (shoutout to all my fellow asthmatics who lack a proper humidifier) with a pot of water on a stovetop and towel draped over your head and the pot, you’re able to breathe in steam which helps relax your lungs. I’ve done this plenty of times before taking my actual medication, and it’s normally a nice experience, albeit a hot one. The thing is, it’s also pretty relaxing, and as my head started to droop, the towel did as well, and there’s one thing that towels don’t enjoy. Hot stove tops.

I started feeling a stinging pain, and I thought the steam wasn’t being properly vented or it was getting too hot, so I lifted my head away from the pot and thought it’d be fine. Cue intense pain. I rip the towel off my head, plunging one of my hands in the boiling water, and I see a significant part of my towel was on fire. (Couldn’t smell it before. Allergies had my nose stuffed up. Also, steam is hot so I didn’t notice the temperature change.) this towel was also wrapped around my head and thankfully had only singed my hair instead of setting it alight. 

The flaming towel was still wrapped around my unboiled hand, so I ran over to the sink while tearing the flaming coil of extra soft cottony death off my hand and arm, turned on the faucet (which was on that powerful multi-stream setting) and sprayed the living hell out of the towel. 

I walked out of it some burns to both of my hands (boiling water and ya know. The fire.) and a lot of singed hair. The towel survived, but it’s been four years and we’ve moved since then, otherwise I’d show off it’s blackened corpse. 

TLDR

Major asthma issues as a result of spring allergies prompted the use of a makeshift humidifier which caught on fire due to the relaxing qualities of steam.

TIFU by eating a chicken sausage in the Himalayas (Kenya/sex toy saga concluded),"Third and final chapter in my travelling mishaps. WARNING this is super long, you have been warned. Here we go:

In the summer of 2017 I was fortunate enough to be invited on a motorcycle trip to India by three friends who are all serious riders. I hadn't owned a bike in 10 years but a few years prior I had manage to ride around Sri Lanka solo with only one major fuck up. They told me to look up the ""Leh - Manali Highway"". I did. I was in.

We flew in to Delhi and then took the tortuous 17 hour bus ride up to Manali. A few days later we collected our bikes from the hire shop; four almost-new Royal Enfield Himalayas.

These are big bikes (180kg?), more than what I was used to (I did Sri Lanka on a Honda XR350) but my confidence grew after a few days riding around Manali. It may surprise some of you but I made it to Leh and onward over Khardung-La (5600m) without incident. It was the return journey where things went wrong.

On the morning we left, we went to our favourite cafe in Leh and I ordered the biggest breakfast possible as the food served at the rest points along the highway is hazardous at best. I've been to India before and as a rule I go vegetarian. Too many horror stories. I didn't realise this breakfast came with a chicken sausage, I was hungry and two of my friends had been eating meat the whole time without consequence. So I thought why not? And this is precisely where I fucked up.

About 6 or 7 hours later we had finished the first days ride towards Manali and were chilling at a place called Pang (4800m). I felt a headache coming on and then my stomach started to feel really strange. I went to lie down in the tent and I started sweating uncontrollably and feeling really cold. Suddenly I felt a bubbling in my stomach and I knew I had to go to the toilet, which was a fetid shack only accessable with a key owned by the lady who ran the rest stop. I couldnt see her, there was no time, so I ran to the nearest boulder and hid behind it and relieved myself. It was awful, pure mudslide. Then I vomited. Then I shat. Then both at the same time, so violently that I was on all fours gasping for air between discharges, nearly choking. After the first round I felt so weak I just collapsed to the side, away from my mess and lay there for a while. It subsided and then it came back. I crawled to a new patch of uncontaminated earth and I repeated the process. This happened two or three more times before one of my friends found me. 

""Help me"" was all I could manage. 

Fortunately I was across the road from the worlds highest army base, and as we discovered on the way up when one of the group was suffering from altitude sickness they have a med bay that's open to travellers (thank you Indian Army!). My friends walked/carried me over to the sentry post and they let us in.
Fortunately the diarrhoea had stopped but I was still periodically throwing up. They put me in a bed, put an oxygen tube in my nose, checked my 02 saturation and gave me a few pills which I took immediately after throwing up in the hope that they could reach my stomach before the next round. I was released and my friends took me back to our tent where I collapsed in bed. I was shivering and shaking so much I needed about 5 woollen blankets on top of my sleeping bag before I could warm up. 

I didnt sleep at all that night, dry heaving up bile every 30 mins, shaking and shivering in a fever-dream that didnt seem to end. What I remember most about this was the insane thirst, I had lost so much liquid but I couldn't drink anything without it coming up. I had become Tantalus. 

By morning the sessions of dry heaving were becoming less frequent but I felt so weak. My friends were all worried that I couldn't make the ride despite my insistence that in a few more hours I would be fine. So we devised a plan, we'd transport my bike onwards to Jispa (the next stop on the return journey) in one of the many hundreds of Indian trucks that trundle along the highway every day. (quick edit: there was a rush to get back because of the insane fines if we were late).

Unfortunately all the trucks staying at Pang had left so we had to wait for the first ones to arrive from Leh, this was a few hours away and those riding bikes had a choice: leave now or risk riding in the dark. I told them to go, no point on waiting around and the camp lady seemed like she had this situation under wraps. I sat in the shade propped up on my backpack and sipped on energy drinks kindly donated by a passing group of Indian motorcyclists, only throwing up once when I was triggered by the sight of a stray dog lapping up one of my many brown pools I'd left from the night before.

Eventually a truck arrived, manned by two brothers who were about the same age as me. The camp matron did all the negotiations and they agreed on a price of 2000 rupees (£25 IIRC). My bike was loaded in the back of the truck, strapped upright (it looked sketchy as hell but it survived the ride with only scratches to the wind-guard which was missed by the hire-shop - some luck at last).

Off we went, in a cloud of beedi smoke with the Indian music cranked up to full blast at a tortuously slow 20 km/h over the unpaved and bumpy mountain highway. (with about 250 km to travel). Every time we did an outside overtake, the non-driving brother would open the door and hang out over the precipice calling directions and occasionally he'd climb out and check on the bike whilst moving. I was in the gaudy War Rig of an Indian Mad Max, shiny, tassle'd and chrome.

I made some light conversation and then managed to sleep for a few hours, waking up at the Kashmir / Himachal Pradesh border. INEXPLICABLY there is a shack selling alcohol inbetween the two border checkpoints. I dont know if this is as a result of some sort of legal loophole but the only people I saw buying were (mostly) solitary truck drivers. Not good India, not good. We stopped and the driver came back grinning with a litre of whisky. I dont know if this is standard practise to drink and drive whilst operating a huge truck on one of the worlds most dangerous roads or they just wanted to party as they had some extra cash and were hanging out with a token white guy. Anyway, I was a bit taken aback when immediately he opened up the bottle, pulled out three cups and poured out a round.

""Drink, Brother"" he said with a grin. I refused.

If you're asking yourself why didn't I try to stop the guy from drinking, he had this really aggro undertone that kind of scared me and I was feeling so weak I could barely move so there was no way I wanted a confrontation or to be dumped at the side of the highway. I reasoned in my mind that he probably drinks a little bit on every trip and could handle it. 

As we continued, more and more shots were being poured out, weaked by a bit of water and accompanied by spicy indian snacks, a near continous smoking of bidis and the occasional spliff. I realised that this would continue until the bottle was gone so I decided to join in, thinking a bottle divided by three would be safer than a bottle divided by two. 

We kept stopping every time he saw a friend coming the other way, utterly indifferent to the fact that he was holding up traffic as the other guy would climb in for a quick round of drinks. This annoyed me at first as it slowed the pace but I took comfort in the fact that the driver would be drinking less alcohol.

With the bottle finished and the last town cleared before Jispa (well, Darcha actually which was only about 30 mins prior). I rejoiced. It should smooth sailing from here right?
INEXPLICABLY we stopped off at a work camp (Killing Sarai) as night fell and he emerged with ANOTHER LITRE, this time of moonshine. I hadn't eaten properly in about 36 hours and my stomach was curdling but I had to power through. The journey got more mental, we were all wasted, the music was pounding and the brothers started quarrelling, at one point we rounded a corner on the outside, the guy spinning the wheel with one hand holding a spliff and punching his brother with the other, not even looking where he was going. Another time we ran into another truck who refused to move, so everyone got out and settled the matter with a fight (we won). I have this image etched into my mind of the guy straining to see in the darkness with mad bloodshot eyes looking like a demon.

To wrap this up, we finally arrived at 1 am in Jispa after 14 hours in the truck. I found my friends tent only after walking into another tent and scaring a poor Indian family. They were super worried / super happy to see me as they had arrived 6 hours earlier and were wondering where the hell I'd got to. We unloaded the bike and I crashed out. I was still really ill but managed to ride back to Manali the next day, where I spent 5 days in bed occasionally running to the toilet as the shits had come back. I lost of lot of weight in this ordeal, at least 5 kg and I'm triggered every-time I hear Indian pop music.

Here are the only photos I managed to take during the incident:

TIFU by almost getting baited into starting a fight,"To be honest, this was a while ago, and it’s a long story, so bear with me. 

This all started at a Starbucks. I went over to do some group work on my world history final. I went and ordered my drink, and in that time, one of the people in my group went in and just wrote the word porn all around the paragraph. A friend stopped him and erased one of them, I came back, found one , and erased one of them. But there was one left. 

Around two weeks later, I had my dad proofread the paper. He caught the last one, and I edited it out. Needless to say, I was fucking livid. I let someone edit my paper, and had I turned it in, it could,be fucked up my grade. So after spending 30 minutes reading through the paper, I decided I would find out who edited it, as I was in a group at Starbucks 

After 3 days, I figured out who edited it. I talked to another one of the people from the group, and he told me he would make sure I would be able to talk to him. 

Lunch comes around. My high school is an open campus, so we can leave school premises to go to lunch. I confront the person, let’s call him Q, and ask him why the fuck he edited my paper. The one who arranged the meeting, let’s call him H, comes in and shoved him. For context, I’m 6’5” and overall menacing. I’m a pacifist at heart, but when Q got shoved, I still stepped in. I told H “I came here to talk, not to fight”. And at that moment my fried who went to get lunch with me told me to look. A group of 15-20 kids were watching, phones presumably recording. Realizing that I got played like a damn fiddle into getting into a fight, I stopped, and said out loud, “ your fun is over, I’m done” and walked back to the table where my friends hang out. I was told that one camera recorded it, but my message was clear, and the drama-deprived crowd was left confused. The footage want sent to the office, but Q still never apologized. No one really one, but that’s kinda the point. 

Tl,dr: someone edited my term paper, and I almost got played into a fight for the amusement of a crowd. Almost

TIFU by going on a chat room and scarring myself and my friend.,"Obviously, this happened yesterday and not today like everything else here. My friend and I had a sleepover and decided to download a chat app, sorta like Omegle. We joined one room and didn’t speak the language the guy was taking in. We left and joined another room. Here’s the consequence of the fuckup. We saw something that I think will stick with me forever. An extremely young looking child (6-10yo) was giving oral sex to an older man. The child was facing the camera and looked completely dead inside. His eyes were emotionless, I assume this wasn’t the first time. What’s so scarring about this to me is that we just saw somebody **raping** a fucking child and we could physically do nothing. We couldn’t stop it because there was no way to. Reporting it doesn’t do shit because there was no registration other than a name required for this app. We can’t take pictures as proof, since that’s child pornography which is illegal. There’s no way I can think of to help this poor kid and I just want to die. I feel like a piece of shit knowing about this and I feel so useless. It’s horrifying and I’m just terrified about everything I do now.

TLDR: I downloaded a video chat room (like Omegle) and saw a man forcing a young child to give him a blowjob. I’m really terrified and I can’t stop thinking about it.

My tip: If you are visiting Philadelphia, skip the Liberty Bell. On a nice summer day I’ll ride by streams of tourists waiting in line to see the famous bell. But what they don’t tell you is that, while the bell has plenty of symbolic relevance, it is of relatively little significance historically. 

IMHO a huge waste of time. You’ll wait in a 45 min line to hear about a bell that was forged, moved, cracked, repaired, cracked again (intentionally) and then moved again. Although it’s kind of cool to touch it. 

I would suggest going to Ben Franklins house, Independence Hall, or for the weirdos The Mutter Museum, if you are visiting Philadelphia. ",CA[deleted],4,17:32.9

TIFU by eating spicy food along with my 9 month pregnant wife.,"So I'm currently posting this from the labor room of a birth care center. Earlier today my dad invited me and my wife to have lunch over at his moms house (my grandma). Now I'm not close to my dad's side of the family but I thought this would be a good chance to see my dad and reconnect with his side of the family.

 Fast forward a few hours and there we are at my grandma's house when we are served a hot steaming plate of rice, beans and carne con chile rojo. For you non spanish speaking people out there carne con chile rojo roughly translates to the devils anus (laughter pause here).
 Anyways this dish is usually a gamble as the spice level is up to the person who cooked and prepared it. I had a general idea of what was in store for me and didn't really care since we came in hungry. As I took the first bite I suddenly realized that I had made a grave mistake as my whole reality was shattered and I was enlightened to what true heat was. I never experienced so much pain eating something in my entire life. Needless to say I finished my plate due to giving in to peer pressure. My wife only finished half of her plate but one bit would be enough to send anyone to the bathroom.

Fast forward to a few hours later my wife is have REALLY bad contractions and I am having REALLY bad stomach problems.
We finally decide that it's time to go to the hospital meanwhile my stomach makes the great decision of saying let's empty out the pipes now. As we are on our way I can only imagine how funny it must look to see both of us performing respiratory exercises to deal with our own problems. When we arrive at the hospital I was probably seconds away from defecating on myself and my wife in serious pain.

Anyway here we are awaiting the results to see if me and my family caused her to go into labor.

I will post an update later this evening.
Or you might just see me introduce my daughter to reddit on r/pics. Whatever comes first. 

TL;DR Me and wife ate spicy food, caused me diarrhea and her labor pains, might have daughter today because of spicy food.",46,6/17/2018 10:45,tifu,steglok,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8rq1hu/tifu_by_eating_spicy_food_along_with_my_9_month/,/r/tifu/comments/8rq1hu/tifu_by_eating_spicy_food_along_with_my_9_month/,8rq1hu,You ate your 9 month pregnant wife?

TIFU by feeding the baby.,"Not today, but last week.  We have an 8 month old baby who had been sick.  He wakes up around 11:30 pm.  Mamma is on maternity leave but hadn’t slept well, so being a self-proclaimed super dad I go in and feed him.  He drinks all of his bottle, then I pick him up for a burp.  That’s when the baby gives me a look and I could feel his stomach convulsing.  As a parent, at that point you have a second or two to decide the best course of action that involves the least amount of clean up, so I just decided to take one for the team and ended up wearing the vomit that came out a few seconds later.  


But, that is not the fuck up - it’s not the first time I’ve been puked on and likely not the last.
 

I call the wife, she gets a towel and cleans up everything on the floor while I’m there covered in puke and it is running down my back. I then hand the baby off and take a shower.  I get out of the shower, grab a towel, dry my hair and the rest of myself - thinking I could still smell it... 


Wife walks in and gives me a horrified look.  Since our bathroom also doubles as our laundry room, she threw the towel in there when she was done cleaning up the mess.  It happened to land on the mat on the outside of the shower.  Since many of our towels look the same, I had assumed that towel was clean and immediately started drying my hair.


A second shower was had shortly afterwards.


TL:DR - Got puked on, took a shower, dried my hair and body in a towel full of baby vomit",7,6/17/2018 11:56,tifu,fraggle_captain,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8rqb1a/tifu_by_feeding_the_baby/,/r/tifu/comments/8rqb1a/tifu_by_feeding_the_baby/,8rqb1a,CB[deleted],CA[deleted],CS[deleted],18:11.7
TIFU by trying to move my neighbor's car,"This literally happened right now. So my neighbors are on holiday and have trusted me with the house (opening/closing the curtains, basically making it look like someone is there). We do this all the time when either of us go away, and have been doing it for years.

Today I'm doing some work on my house and realised I didn't have a jet wash, so I sent my neighbor a text to ask if I could have a look in his garage and borrow his. To my luck he text me back and said ""sure, but you'll need to move the car away from the door first. Keys are upstairs."" Great, all I need to do is move the car a few feet and I can get the garage door open and carry on with my stuff. Sounds easy right?

So I find his keys and start the engine. It's a pretty nice car, Audi RS3, so it rumbles as I turn the key. Wow, this is pretty nice. Manual too, I learnt to drive in a manual and have been driving one for about a year now. 

Now you need to picture this - I've got the door open and only one foot inside the car, I only want to move it a few feet so I am going to drive it real slow, not even push the accelerator, and just apply the handbrake once I've moved it away. I stick it into 1st gear and start rolling. The clutch has a fairly low release, so I start moving a bit faster than I expected. My brain suddenly goes into ""oh shit I need to brake"" mode. Thing is, I only have one foot inside the car, so my stupid ass lets go of the clutch completely so I can press the brake.

If you've ever drove a manual before, you would know that releasing the clutch too fast causes the car to jolt forwards. So the car jumps right into the gate at the front of his driveway, crumpling the whole front bumper and registration plate.

I look around to see if anyone's watching, maybe I can get away with it and send my neighbor a text in a few days saying ""hey I think someone bumped into your car"". To my left is another neighbor sat in his front garden, cigar in hand, shaking his head. Across the road a woman is watching in the window, she's got her phone in her hand, I'm guessing she was recording. I'm fucked right now.

Damages to a front bumper of an RS3 can be up to €1000. Not sure how I can break this to my neighbor, I'm literally shaking right now.

TL;DR tried to move my neigbor's car 3 feet. Let go of the clutch to quickly, car jumped straight into the driveway gate, crippling the whole front bumper.",5,6/17/2018 12:39,tifu,Big_Sperming_Whale,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8rqhhp/tifu_by_trying_to_move_my_neighbors_car/,/r/tifu/comments/8rqhhp/tifu_by_trying_to_move_my_neighbors_car/,8rqhhp,Do not ruin his vacation.

TIFU by licking a poop covered foot.,"TIFU by tasting organic cat shit 

Obligatory, not actually today... However I was eating chocolate spread toast for breakfast, and I was sitting on my boyfriends bed. I sit crosses leg because I find it comfortable. 

So I went to the kitchen to make a drink after eating my first slice of toast. Black currant squash, if you’d like to know. When I came back and sat on the bed crossed legged to eat my second slice, I saw something brown, almost like a smudge, on the side of the sole of my foot. 

Instinctively thinking it was chocolate spread, I used my finger to wipe it off my skin and then licked my finger. 

It tasted like fucking shit. Even now I can’t forget the taste. My boyfriend’s cat is fed organic food as he’s been spoiled within an inch of his life.   

I got up immediately, gagging and coughing and ran to the bathroom and threw up. 

My boyfriend’s cat, whose litter tray is the kitchen, had missed and pooped on the floor. I’d accidentally stepped into the side of it as I’d gone to make my drink. 

I’ve hated him ever since. 

I always felt like he did it on purpose because I took his owner from him... Every time I see him standing in the corridor, he squints his eyes and me and doesn’t blink and I *know* he remembers. 

TL;DR stepped in my boyfriend’s cat’s poop, licked it because it looked like chocolate spread.

"Tifu laziness results in a bomb squad, helicopter and apology","June,  2007 Fort Irwin, California

We finished our month long military exercise, I and my clothes smelled like shit from going 2 weeks without a shower in the Mojave Desert. One of the last things I packed before leaving was my blank adapter which covers the barrel of the rifle enabling it to shoot blank ammo. We land in Texas and immediately throw my shit in the trunk of the car and forget about it...

August, 2007: Fort Hood, Texas

My best friend from college came down from Pennsylvania to visit. Brent enjoyed his time in the Army then let it all go....the guy looked like a homeless railroad hobo. I didn't have room for him at the barracks so I was dropping him off at a fellow battle buddy's place to get some sleep. It was night time so finding my buddy's place turned into a chore. We finally find it and I turn into a parking spot and the car behind us turns on the red and blue lights...

I hadn't seen my friend in a couple years and the cop asks who was with me. I told him ""Brent""

""Bren't who?""

I forget Brent's last name...

Crap....handcuff's

I'm nonchalant about all this cause at some point this has to end....even though I look around and there is nothing but flashing red and blue lights...

Two hours later: The dogs finally arrive. While the drug dog is walking around my car I ask the cop who detained me ""What do you do besides part time cop?"" He replies ""I'm a Methodist preacher""

Here's my opening to build some common ground- ""I used to counsel at a Bible Camp in Minnesota."" I said this one sentence then hear the thumping blades of a helicopter and the spot light hits us...The officer looks over, his face blank ""I'm so sorry, I saw your antenna's and thought there was a bomb in your car""...I look at him and say ""It's ok, honest mistake."" ( I had a CB Radio, and amateur radio gear so my car was an antenna farm on the back.)

As the cop continues to apologize: the bomb dog takes a trip around my car. Years of laziness, procrastination & 3 month old gun powder residue collides with the dogs ass touching the ground. My night just got longer...

Three hours later: everyone is finally convinced there isn't a bomb in my car. They give me the keys so I open the trunk and one officers jaw drops. I'm still in cuffs and cant do shit so I smile and say ""have at it guys."" The officer looks over in contempt ""You need to clean your fucking car."" I smile and watch years of shit cleaned out of the car until they found the blank adapter.

Law enforcement does wonderful detail work- No charge.

TIFU by crashing my parents cars,"(This happened today)So my mom told me to move the car in the driveway, easy right? So I go to the car and start it on, problem was that the street I lived on was so crowed and could barely have 2 cars fill the width of the streets... So I put the car in reverse so I could do a U turn.. Then a truck comes down the road in the middle of my U turn. I figured he was in a hurry since he honked and seemed impatient. I was halfway into my U turn so I did the risky move of not backing up and continuing the turn which ended up crashing into my dad's truck. 
The driver pulled down his window and laughed while driving on...
I was in a state of shocked and my heart beat was going 120 rpm... My mom ran out and screamed ""What happened?"" I told here what happened and she was fucking pissed.. When my dad came home I told him and he checked the damage of his truck and my moms car..The damage on my dad's truck were a lot of scrapes and small dents on the passenger side .. And my mom's car had the same but also had 2 huge cracks in the right front bumper... FML


TL:DR
I was going to do a U turn to park my mom's car in the driveway,  then an impatient driver comes along  and honks, i felt rushed so I kept on driving instead of creating more space to do the turn, I ended crashing my mom and dad's truck and car.... fuck me

TIFU by stabbing myself in my hand with a fork,"Like others this didn't happen today and this isn't my FU. This is my friend's so I'll say this story as a third-person. And also I am typing on mobile so don't bully me for formatting.

So around 6 or 7 years ago, my friend was a bit bored. He decided to go to the kitchen to eat a snack. Over there, while grabbing a snack, he noticed a fork sitting in the middle of the counter. He decided that he wanted to go kill himself. He decided the quickest way to achieve this task was to stab himself in his hand as hard as he could.

He grabbed the fork and raised his hand, (the fork facing down. As he thrusted the metal fork down), he yelled ""FOR LIIIIIIFE!"" (friend doesn't remember that part but his mom insists he said that.)

Long story short, friend had to go to the hospital to get stitches in his middle and index fingers.

TL:DR Friend was bored and decided to kill himself so he took a metal fork and stabbed his hand. He went to the hospital to get stitches
