These two characters are from the show and manga Dragon Ball, the starter of the franchise that spawned Dragon Ball Z. The character in front is Mercenary Tao, a villain who flies by (get this) chopping down a tree with his hand, punching it so hard all the branches come off, then throwing it and jumping onto it. [Here's a video that starts with him launching a pillar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxkfwXX46HY).

The second character is the beloved Goku. At this point he's not powerful enough to actually fly fast using his own ki. Instead he flies on the Flying Nimbus (the yellow cloud) he was gifted.

At one point Goku does chase down Mercenary Tao on a revenge mission because Tao killed the dad of one of his friends.",CA[deleted],697,31:34.0

If a single UV photons hit one of these cells in the wrong spot as it's preparing to split (which is how more cells are produced), this can cause it to start misbehaving, and be the start of cancer. 

If this cell is not an regular skin cell but a pigmentation cell, it's even worse since those are able to metastasize even without unintended mutation. Now you have cancer that can spread throughout your body. 

Edit: just to clarify, the UV photon has to hit *exactly* the right spot at *exactly* the right time to cause cancer. The risk of any one photon doing so is extremely small, but the number of photons in sunlight is extremely large which is why it happens sometimes. ",CA[deleted],1,32:53.8

Disabling Scoped ARs in the Sniper Shootout LTM,"Heya Folks,

&nbsp;

We‚Äôve gotten a lot of feedback around the inclusion of the Scoped ARs in the Sniper Shootout LTM. 

&nbsp;

The LTM was designed with long range Sniper combat in mind and the standard Scoped ARs do not stay true to this design. However, we feel that the Thermal Scoped AR still fits the ‚ÄúSeek and Eliminate‚Äù style of the LTM and will remain for the time being, albeit with a reduced drop rate.

&nbsp;

Thanks!

Fisheries, like agriculture and energy, need some public support to enable the stability that benefits everyone. Some of that public support is in the form of the managed fisheries in place already.

The Phone Call,"I know we all have had those phone calls. The ones from customers after they get take-out and something was messed up. They can range from the upset woman, who got the chicken when it was supposed to be steak, who just wants it to be comped the next time she comes in to the raging man who found 1 onion in his taco and is planning to drive to the store to scream at the manager and wants everyone fired. It's always a little nerve racking when you deal with these phone calls. 

The procedure for my store when getting one of these phone calls is to get a manager immediately but I feel like I can deal with these customers better than my managers. And my managers all know this so I am allowed to take these calls. It was a busy Thursday evening because we have a burrito special so the store was slammed. We also have Uber Eats which means we have Uber drivers coming in and out getting takeout orders. If you know anything about Uber Eats they can sometimes write comments to specify certain things that they want done. 

After we slowed down a little bit we got an Uber order and in the comments the man said ""could you please add napkins and draw a smiley face on something to make me a little happy tonight."" Of course after I showed all of the servers we all freaked out and decided we would write him so many notes just to brighten up his evening. We ended up making over 50 notes including jokes, drawings, little stories. (and an extra side of queso) I felt really nice to be able to do something for someone. 

So as I was getting ready to clock out one of the other servers comes and gets me and says there's a man on the phone and wants to speak to a manager about something but they're all busy so can you take this? Of course I'm like oh geez I do not want to be dealing with this right before I leave but I reluctantly agree and ask him how I can help. He proceeds to tell me that he was the one who placed the Uber order and after receiving all of the notes he just wanted to call and say thank you. He started to cry on the phone and I didn't know what to say so I just told him that we loved serving him and we hope to continue to do so. 

He told me that he wishes he would he was able to come into the restaurant but hadn't been able to leave his house in years. His little splurge every week was ordering takeout from our store. I started to tear up and asked him to hold on for a minute. I got all of the servers and put him on speaker phone I said ""Hello from Chain Mexican Restaurant we all just wanted to say have a great night"" and all the girls got the cue and started saying have a good night. Enjoy your burrito! We can't wait to do this next week! I took the phone off speaker phone after everyone had said something. I told him that he was now not only a valued customer but a friend. I thanked him again and hung up. Now I'm sitting in my car crying thinking about this stranger and I hoped we helped him.",1890,6/15/2018 2:28,TalesFromYourServer,Philosopheraven,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/8r76h6/the_phone_call/,/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/8r76h6/the_phone_call/,8r76h6,Heartwarming.

No. You know what? Just go away.

Every time someone posts a picture, a gif, a video, a screenshot, or just anything really that involves some kind of ""corporate"" thing - A video game, a logo, or probably just even the town hall of a city given how overboard you dummies go, you have to [/r/HailCorporate](/r/shittymoviedetails) it.

I'm done. I've had enough. You can't just spam [/r/HailCorporate](/r/bobcobble) and expect an upvote. You can't just be like ""dude, you're playing a game?"" and post [/r/HailCorporate](/r/onionhate). You just can't.

I doubt you even work for corporate given how against them you are. You live in a cardboard box, typing on your CrapBook Pro, feeling good about yourself because you think you just ""called someone else out"" for being a corporate shill.

Just who do you think you are? Some epic 12-year-old on the internet with le cool fedora posting about how ""corporate shill hails this, corporate shill hails that?"" Well, I've got news for you. You aren't anything. You aren't epic, you aren't a 12-year-old, and your fedora certainly isn't le cool.

I hope in time you will learn that not everybody and everything is a corporate shill.

> The U.S. is reportedly planning to pull out of the UN&#039;s Human Rights Council after clashes over key issues such as Israel.

> U.S. ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley has clashed with the council over its treatment of Israel, and has repeatedly voted against UN measures that were critical of that country.

> &quot;When the council passes more than 70 resolutions against Israel, a country with a strong human rights record, and just seven resolutions against Iran, a country with an abysmal human rights record, you know something is seriously wrong,&quot; she wrote in an op-ed for the Washington Post last June.The U.S. rejoined the council under former President Obama after boycotting for three years under former President George W. Bush.Haley has also called for other reforms to the body, including making it easier to expel member states with poor human rights records, specifically Venezuela, China and Saudi Arabia.

The trail itself is an unmaintained ancient Hopi route that covers ~3mi with a ~3000+ foot elevation change through Salt Trail Canyon to the Little Colorado River (pictured). The ‚Äútrail‚Äù is basically gravel and bouldering the whole way through which makes it extremely slow going because you have to carefully place each step and boulder hop. Anyway, at this point we had just arrived at camp and were extremely overheated. We hit a snag on the hike in and it took us a lot longer than we expected, leaving us exposed to the sun for the last two hours of the hike. It. Was. Brutal.

Victoria III was born on the battlefield, her mother's labor induced by the lethal marksmanship of her human lover.  The evil human, Rick, had showed his true colors once he found out she was pregnant, and they had been enemies ever since.  They met on the field of battle, and slew each other with arrows.  Although she bears her mother's name and armor, Victoria III is a half elf, torn between two cultures that do not accept her.  Yet she still charges forward, fiercely protecting the meek and impoverished, eager to redeem the family name.  

I don't do much free work anymore, but every once in a while I troll r/characterdrawing for something inspiring to work on, just for funsies.  u/DanniGat made such a compelling post, I just had to go all out for it.  u/joiful88 is the mother of this lovely young lady, and it was an honor working with them to give her a very special surprise.  You can watch the video we recorded of her reaction here: [LINK](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/273313849).  

The picture took about 18 solid hours of work.  You can find all the recordings on Twitch.

Sodapoppin and other big streamers are about to get sponsored by one of the biggest online fraudster,"\*Cross-posting my own post from r/sodapoppin, I did not have enough karma on this account yesterday to post in here

Hey to everyone from a throwaway account (I kinda do like my life and not really interested to lose it ;))!

I hope there is still time for me to warn all of you before all this shit blows up and it will no longer be possible to do anything against it. I hope I will be able to prevent all this from happening.

Let¬¥s start from the beginning. There is a guy named \[Vlad\]([https://twitter.com/vladtweeting](https://twitter.com/vladtweeting)) who is the founder of a company named \[Kickback\]([https://www.linkedin.com/company/kickback-gg/](https://www.linkedin.com/company/kickback-gg/)). At the beginning his company provided a 1v1 csgo games for real money. At the time csgo skin gambling became a huge business and Vlad teamed up with FaZe Rain and FaZe Banks and they together worked on a website called csgowild. In 2016 Valve announced that all csgo gambling sites have to shut down immediately (csgowild at the time actually did shut down). Approximately a year after that Vlad created a completely rigged csgo skin opening website called SkinHub. These unreagulated casinos need something called \[""provably fair system""\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provably\_fair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provably_fair)). SkinHub had one to look legit to their customers, but the code strings never matched and users were being displayed \[fake outcomes\]([https://imgur.com/a/AKEUw](https://imgur.com/a/AKEUw)) (multiple proves and plus a lot of interesting things to read). This way Vlad was able to earn insane amounts and was able to abuse the power of money to get rid of their competitors offering insane deals to content creators. We are talking up to $300,000 for a single youtube video for a youtuber with 4 million subscribers. He also bought back CsgoWild and also started rigging games there (bots playing against users), which he got \[exposed\]([http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n\_1sqclek](http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1sqclek)) the same week he launched the site, haha.

In the past few months Valve was pretty succefull getting rid of those highly illegal gambling websites. All Vlad¬¥s csgo skin sites are now gone, but Vlad is not. He just launched a bitcoin rulette site called \[Slip\]([slip.gg](https://slip.gg/)) and many more are ready to come. Considering Vlad¬¥s history, we can expect what is comming on us.

According to my leaks from multiple sources straith from Kickback this will come very soon. Streamers are simply not able to say no to the offers they are currently receiving (again, hundreds of thousands of dollars a month).

Please, try to do something against this yourself, Twitch will NOT do anything. Twitch will NOT ban gambling, nor say anything. Kickback¬¥s \[major investor\]([https://twitter.com/justinkan](https://twitter.com/justinkan?lang=cs)) was a major investor for Twitch. Wonder why csgo skin gambling was not allowed on Twitch after the PhantomL0rd scandal, but those case opening websites (yes, skinhub) were? Yeah...

Please, again, if we will not be able to stop these sponsorships from happening, just dont play on these sites that will be heavilly advertised, your money will never be safe.

Thanks,

"We are doctors developing hormonal male contraceptives, AMA!","There's been a lot of press recently about new methods of male birth control and some of their trials and tribulations, and there have been some great questions (see [https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/85ceww/male\_contraceptive\_pill\_is\_safe\_to\_use\_and\_does/](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/85ceww/male_contraceptive_pill_is_safe_to_use_and_does/)).  We're excited about some of the developments we've been working on and so we've decided to help clear things up by hosting an AMA. Led by andrologists Drs. Christina Wang and Ronald Swerdloff  at Harbor UCLA/LABioMed and Drs. Stephanie Page and Brad Anawalt at the University of Washington, the male contraceptive researchers at LABioMed are looking forward to your questions as they pertain to the science of male contraception and its impact on society.  Ask us anything!

"[ART] [Commissioned] Loki Seolt√≥ir, Awakened Cat Wizard with a human familiar",,8038,6/16/2018 15:59,DnD,Erixperience,https://i.imgur.com/mhL2RY1.jpg,/r/DnD/comments/8rjv5m/art_commissioned_loki_seolt√≥ir_awakened_cat/,8rjv5m,">*Loki was an average housecat, at one time. For years he lived with a wealthy older woman and her servant, who actually took care of him. When sickness took the aging servant and he passed on, Loki ran away, feeling like he no longer belonged.*


>*After a few weeks on the streets and then the woods, an eccentric hermit of a druid happened to notice the wandering cat, and took him in. For reasons he never shared, he used the powerful Awaken spell to give his newly acquired companion his own mind.*


>*With intelligence comes freedom, however, and Loki eventually chose to leave and look upon the world with new eyes. After a year or so, he happened upon a Wizarding College and curiosity took hold of him. He stayed in the shadows, gleaning what he could of the Arcane Arts, and eventually stole materials to create his own spellbook.*


>*The first spell he cast with his newfound magic was Find Familiar, in a last-ditch effort to bring back the man who had cared for him. While his appearance was the same as his old friend, the soul within was not.*


>*Accepting that his longtime friend was well and truly gone, he set out once more to see the world, occasionally using his familiar as a disguise for times when a talking cat would never be trusted, passing himself off as the familiar by using illusions to make it look as if the man spoke.*

***

>*Now Loki, along with several other unusual folk, has been commissioned to attend an incredibly exclusive gala and...* liberate... *a particularly priceless enchanted bust. Truly, an opportunity that only arises once in nine lifetimes.*

A few months ago, I saw someone post art of an [Awakened Cat Druid]( https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/80dyq4/art_my_dm_allowed_me_to_play_as_an_awakened/), and I instantly knew what I wanted to play for my next character.  One of the players in my group (who's an experienced Pathfinder DM) offered to run a one-shot, giving me the chance to finally play the strangest character concept I've come up with to date.

The stone around his neck doubles both as the magical item that gives him sentience, and as his Arcane Focus. I also opted to go for the School of Illusion, as I felt that it fit the theme of a secretive trickster cat much better than the other choices.

Personally, I can't wait to see what the rest of my group thinks once they find out [I'm actually playing the cat.]( http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/SJHYdnaiVz)

A simulation for how octanethiol molecules bond to a film of gold and then self-assemble into a well ordered monolayer (SAM),,2246,6/16/2018 22:24,chemicalreactiongifs,crnaruka,https://i.imgur.com/Dj24i1y.gifv,/r/chemicalreactiongifs/comments/8rme6k/a_simulation_for_how_octanethiol_molecules_bond/,8rme6k,"**Explanation:**
---


This simulation gives a quick demonstration of the process involved in creating [a self-assembled monolayer on metals.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-assembled_monolayer) These are layers one molecule thick that coat the surface of a film. One neat aspect is that even such an incredibly thin layer can drastically change the properties of the surface. For example, pure silver is rather hydrophilic. In other words, water interacts quite strongly with it and can easily wet it. However once you add a single layer of octanethiol molecules, the situation changes drastically. The surface modified film now becomes strongly hydrophobic, so now water rather than wetting the film would tend to bead up and/or slip off entirely .

The reason is that octanethiol is composed of two main parts, an S-H head group that can anchor to the gold and a fatty hydrocarbon tail, a bit as shown in [this cartoon](https://i.imgur.com/qEaKRSz.png). This clip (simulated via [molecular dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics)) shows a nice summary of what happens once the thiol (SH) head group binds to anchor to the metal. The organic tails of adjacent molecules jostle around until they arrange into a tight arrangement where they can maximize their attraction (Van der Waals forces). The fatty organic film that envelops the gold may be thin, but it's enough to now effectively repel water. [For example here is the effect in action (on gold rather than silver).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvgEd71nHUg)
