Discussion Megathread: Final Senate Confirmation Vote On Brett Kavanaugh,"The Senate is slated to take its final vote on the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh later on Saturday, and barring any changes in senators' publicly announced decisions, he’s expected to be confirmed.

President Trump's nomination of Kavanaugh in July has been followed by nearly three months of controversy, a pair of confirmation hearings that consumed Washington — one that examined his judicial thinking, and the other in which the nominee denied allegations involving sexual misconduct by several different women — and two weeks of large-scale protests against the nomination that have swept Capitol Hill. The final vote, which requires a simple majority, comes exactly a month before Election Day.
	
The vote will come at the end of the 30-hour period that began on Friday at 10:52 a.m. EDT. The vote is expected to be taken sometime between 4:45 p.m. and 5 p.m. EDT. 
	
Cable news networks and network channels will be broadcasting the Senate vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination. You can also [watch the vote on C-SPAN 2.](https://www.c-span.org/networks/?channel=c-span-2) You can watch the Senate livestream by clicking [here.](https://livestream.com/fednet/senate)",1129,2018-10-06 18:49:55,politics,PoliticsModeratorBot,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/9lxw3t/discussion_megathread_final_senate_confirmation/,/r/politics/comments/9lxw3t/discussion_megathread_final_senate_confirmation/,9lxw3t,"Decries partisanship, proceeds to constantly smear Democrats",CA[deleted],1,2018-10-06 13:44:36

We are BuzzFeed News investigative reporters tracking suspicious payments to Trump associates. Ask Us Anything.,"I am Anthony Cormier, an investigative reporter from BuzzFeed News. For the past year, my partner, Jason Leopold, and I have been tracking suspicious bank transactions to and from those in President Trump's orbit. We reported on [Paul Manafort's financial activity](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/fbi-probe-of-paul-manafort-focuses-on-13-suspicious-wire) the day before his indictment, investigated [unusual](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/secret-finding-60-russian-payments-to-finance-election) [transfers](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/newly-uncovered-russian-payments-are-a-focus-of-election) at the Russian embassy, discovered cash transactions by a [GOP operative](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/peter-w-smith-hillary-clinton-emails-trump-flynn-money), and reported on the financial web linked to an accused [Russian agent](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/maria-butina-paul-erickson-suspicious-bank-money-russia). More recently, we published two stories on a string of transactions shortly [before](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/anthonycormier/mueller-investigation-money-trump-tower-meeting) and [after](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/anthonycormier/trump-tower-meeting-suspicious-transactions-agalarov) the notorious Trump Tower meeting in June 2016 — which are now part of the wide-ranging Mueller inquiry. Ask us anything! 

We'll start answering questions at 2pm ET.

EDIT:

After five hours, we are wrapping things up. Thank you so much for all of these great questions.

You responded with this fascinating answer: ""*I do and I'm not at liberty to report it right now….there is a working theory as it relates particularly to the Kislyak transactions and the attempted withdrawal of money…that relates directly to the ""core mattter"". They (sources) are hesitant to even remotely broach it on background, let alone on the record. But there are specific lines of inquiry that the special counsel's office, or the people its working with, have taken. We know from really reliable individuals who have first-hand knowledge that they are keen to know about the $150k as it relates to Kislyak's conversations and meetings with administration officials. There's a reason that we're (journalists) interested in meetings (with Kislyak), those are really important. The investigators are beyond due diligence,* ***they have very specific thoughts on what this could have been used for*** *and they are running it down as hard as humanly possible.* ""

So my question is, are you now at liberty to report on what that theory/line of inquiry is, and/or has it already been answered by subsequent reporting?

Thanks, and great work guys!",CA[deleted],171,2018-10-06 13:59:31

/r/Politics is looking for more moderators!,"#Hello /r/politics users! 

As you may be aware, this subreddit recently reached a milestone when we passed the 4,000,000 user mark. This is an incredibly active subreddit, and that is and has always been evidenced by a very large amount of user reports, and it can be a challenge to address reports on comments and submissions in addition to everything else we have going on such as AMA's, Modmail, Megathreads, etc.

We have always had a [link in our sidebar](https://politicsmodapp.herokuapp.com/) where users can apply to be a moderator, but the truth is we don't get many applications at all, so we have decided to reach out to users on a larger scale. 

#Who are we looking for?

We are looking for users that have a significant amount of time to contribute to moderating. This is a highly active subreddit with a large volume of reports, if you can only be available a few hours a week when things need doing, this is not the position for you.

We are looking for users who want to be here and will put in the time to learn the ropes. Especially in the beginning, it's a large investment of time and patience to learn our rules and procedures. If you think you can't commit to that, this is not the position for you.

Everyone has opinions, but we strive for impartiality, we will not tolerate biased decision-making. This is not your soapbox, all mods are expected to leave their opinions at the door. If you don't think you can do that, this is not the position for you. We will be reviewing your work and anyone who does not adhere to this will have all permissions revoked immediately and will be removed from their position. 

We expect a history of civil behavior in our subreddit. It's imperative that we know if given the chance to engage with the subreddit and users in an official capacity you will do so in accordance with our rules. 

This of course doesn't represent the entirety of what we are looking for, but if you believe you fit the above criteria we will absolutely review your application! We will remove this sticky when we believe we have enough applicants to move forward with, and we thank you in advance for your applications.

"I’m Dr. Danielle Mitchell, progressive Democratic candidate for Congress in one of the reddest areas of the country, Tennessee’s 3rd District. AMA!","Hi Reddit! My name is Dr. Danielle Mitchell, and I’m running for Congress against incumbent, Rep. Chuck Fleischmann, in TN-03. Our district mostly centers around Chattanooga in the southeastern corner of the state, but we also represent a whole swath of generally rural counties across east Tennessee.  I am running with [Brand New Congress](https://brandnewcongress.com), a team of progressive candidates campaigning on a platform of getting money out of politics, rebuilding our broken healthcare system and reforming our unjust criminal justice system, among other points. Our group has seen some success with candidates like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez winning in NY-14, and now we’re trying to carry that same message of hope and reform to an area that traditionally leans heavily conservative.

My background is a major reason why I’ve decided to get involved in public service. As a child, my father worked in construction while my mother was a school bus driver. Though they provided as they could and to the best of their abilities, my family did experience real economic hardships, and that lead to a life of moving from city to city, house to house, often after evictions and sudden job losses. These difficulties only became worse when my younger brother died due to complications from treatable epilepsy a short time before his thirteenth birthday. We were simply unable to afford continuous health care for him. The memory of these personal experiences and the desire to help others in a similar situation drove me as I put myself through medical school and eventually opened my own clinic in Chattanooga.

I believe that our healthcare system mirrors what is wrong with our current government. Both are dependent on private interest groups and the politicians that are bought off by them. It is my firm belief that a sense of ethics and a focus on people applies not only in medicine, but in how we should judge and elect our leaders. Unfortunately, many longtime career politicians like Rep. Fleischmann have forgotten - or never have known - what it means to truly struggle day-to-day as so many Americans currently do. I believe that we can come together in November and show Congress that informed, concerned everyday people can overcome the influence of big money in politics, regardless of political affiliation or socioeconomic status. With that said, ask me anything!

Edit: Thanks Reddit! Loved answering your questions. To everyone who came through and asked questions, I promise we got to as many as we could in time!
