Discussion Megathread: Final Senate Confirmation Vote On Brett Kavanaugh,"The Senate is slated to take its final vote on the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh later on Saturday, and barring any changes in senators' publicly announced decisions, he’s expected to be confirmed.

President Trump's nomination of Kavanaugh in July has been followed by nearly three months of controversy, a pair of confirmation hearings that consumed Washington — one that examined his judicial thinking, and the other in which the nominee denied allegations involving sexual misconduct by several different women — and two weeks of large-scale protests against the nomination that have swept Capitol Hill. The final vote, which requires a simple majority, comes exactly a month before Election Day.
	
The vote will come at the end of the 30-hour period that began on Friday at 10:52 a.m. EDT. The vote is expected to be taken sometime between 4:45 p.m. and 5 p.m. EDT. 
	
Cable news networks and network channels will be broadcasting the Senate vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination. You can also [watch the vote on C-SPAN 2.](https://www.c-span.org/networks/?channel=c-span-2) You can watch the Senate livestream by clicking [here.](https://livestream.com/fednet/senate)",1273,2018-10-06 18:49:55,politics,PoliticsModeratorBot,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/9lxw3t/discussion_megathread_final_senate_confirmation/,/r/politics/comments/9lxw3t/discussion_megathread_final_senate_confirmation/,9lxw3t,">What you need to know about secret misconduct complaints abt Kavanaugh:

We are BuzzFeed News investigative reporters tracking suspicious payments to Trump associates. Ask Us Anything.,"I am Anthony Cormier, an investigative reporter from BuzzFeed News. For the past year, my partner, Jason Leopold, and I have been tracking suspicious bank transactions to and from those in President Trump's orbit. We reported on [Paul Manafort's financial activity](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/fbi-probe-of-paul-manafort-focuses-on-13-suspicious-wire) the day before his indictment, investigated [unusual](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/secret-finding-60-russian-payments-to-finance-election) [transfers](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/newly-uncovered-russian-payments-are-a-focus-of-election) at the Russian embassy, discovered cash transactions by a [GOP operative](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/peter-w-smith-hillary-clinton-emails-trump-flynn-money), and reported on the financial web linked to an accused [Russian agent](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/maria-butina-paul-erickson-suspicious-bank-money-russia). More recently, we published two stories on a string of transactions shortly [before](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/anthonycormier/mueller-investigation-money-trump-tower-meeting) and [after](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/anthonycormier/trump-tower-meeting-suspicious-transactions-agalarov) the notorious Trump Tower meeting in June 2016 — which are now part of the wide-ranging Mueller inquiry. Ask us anything! 

We'll start answering questions at 2pm ET.

EDIT:

After five hours, we are wrapping things up. Thank you so much for all of these great questions. Future updates to our [Money Trail series will be posted here](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/collection/themoneytrail). Follow BuzzFeed News on social media for the latest and check out [this page](https://support.buzzfeednews.com/) for other ways to support our reporting.",3938,2018-10-05 18:04:15,politics,buzzfeednews,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/9lo4jp/we_are_buzzfeed_news_investigative_reporters/,/r/politics/comments/9lo4jp/we_are_buzzfeed_news_investigative_reporters/,9lo4jp,"Anthony, on a podcast you did with Ben Wittes at Lawfare on January 17th, 2018 (relating to this story: [""Investigators Are Scrutinizing Newly Uncovered Payments By The Russian Embassy""](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/newly-uncovered-russian-payments-are-a-focus-of-election)) Ben asked you this question: ""*…Do you think there's a specific theory that connects these (payments) with the (core) Russia matter (that Mueller is investigating)?*""

You responded with this fascinating answer: ""*I do and I'm not at liberty to report it right now….there is a working theory as it relates particularly to the Kislyak transactions and the attempted withdrawal of money…that relates directly to the ""core mattter"". They (sources) are hesitant to even remotely broach it on background, let alone on the record. But there are specific lines of inquiry that the special counsel's office, or the people its working with, have taken. We know from really reliable individuals who have first-hand knowledge that they are keen to know about the $150k as it relates to Kislyak's conversations and meetings with administration officials. There's a reason that we're (journalists) interested in meetings (with Kislyak), those are really important. The investigators are beyond due diligence,* ***they have very specific thoughts on what this could have been used for*** *and they are running it down as hard as humanly possible.* ""

So my question is, are you now at liberty to report on what that theory/line of inquiry is, and/or has it already been answered by subsequent reporting?

Thanks, and great work guys!",CA[deleted],168,2018-10-06 15:40:16

Discussion Megathread: Senate Vote On Brett Kavanaugh Confirmation,"With key lawmakers undecided, senators are set to begin voting on whether to advance Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court.
