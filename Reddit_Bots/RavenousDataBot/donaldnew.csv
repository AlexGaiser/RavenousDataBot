The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like ‚ÄúMa'am, you need to pay for those first.‚Äù At first she kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took the bag of peaches to weigh, she stopped her and told her to weigh them each individually ‚Äúto prevent any electrical infetterence,‚Äù and then turned around and winked at me. I don‚Äôt even think that‚Äôs a word. After she weighed each peach and put them in the bag and started to say the price, she kept interrupting her by shouting ""IN PEACH FORTAH FIVE.""

Cory Booker

So much for stealing second

Telling one's own personal story is often the most powerful way to make a point, or, more importantly, to make people think. When grandiose statements entrenched in politically correct terminology are made, many may listen but few will hear. When I hesitated in writing this column, I realized I was basking in hypocrisy. So instead I chose to write and risk. New Year's Eve 1984 I will never forget. I was 15. As the ball dropped, I leaned over to hug a friend and she met me instead with an overwhelming kiss. As we fumbled upon the bed, I remember debating my next ""move"" as if it were a chess game. With the ""Top Gun"" slogan ringing in my head, I slowly reached for her breast. After having my hand pushed away once, I reached my ""mark."" Our groping ended soon and while no ""relationship"" ensued, a friendship did. You see, the next week in school she told me that she was drunk that night and didn't really know what she was doing. While she liked me a lot, she said she just wanted to be friends. I have gotten used to those five words, but that's another column. Ever since puberty, I remember receiving messages that sex was a game, a competition. Sexual relations were best achieved through luck, guile, strategy or coercion. Another friend in high school counseled me on the importance of drink-

ing: ""With liquor you'll get to bed quicker,"" she said. Thinking about her statement back then, I realized its veracity. Coming to college, I was immersed in the same sort of attitudes. ""What do you think happened? She invited me back to her room at 3 a.m."" ""I've got to find a way to snatch that snatch."" ""The best thing for that girl would be to be tied down and screwed."" Out of context these statements seem shocking, but in context they were barely noticed. After two years at Stanford, I snapped from one extreme to the other. Once, during my sophomore year, in response to a slew of my verbiage, a friend of mine chidingly called me a man-hater. In retrospect, my soliloquy titled ""The Oppressive Nature Of Male Dominated Society And Its Violent Manifestations: Rape, Anorexia, Battered Wives"" may have been a surreptitious attempt to convince her that I was a sensitive man, but more likely I was trying to convince myself that my attitudes had changed. My polar leap had little to do with residential education. It had to do with a deluge of reality. You see, I had begun listening to the raw truth from men and women discussing rape about two years ago as a peer counselor. The conversations were personal accounts, not rhetoric; they were real life, not dorm programing. It was a

wake-up call ‚Äî I will never be the same. I find myself with no conclusion for this column. A conclusion would speak of a simplicity I do not feel. I can find little clarity in the torment of emotions I now experience when even allusions to this issue are made. All I have are poignant visions. I see that preceding all the horrors of rape are a host of skewed attitudes. I see my friends seeking to ""get some"" or to ""score."" I see people making power plays. I see myself at 15 trotting around the bases and stealing second. I now see the crowds, no, not the spectators, but the thousands, the millions who are rarely seen or heard. I've seen enough. I spoke to a 40 year old woman who has trouble looking at her self in the mirror when she gets out of the shower; to her, her body is always dirty. She can't make love, she never had an orgasm, she never will forget what happened her first time. She can't close her eyes.

Cory values the dialogue he has received in response to his column and welcomes more.

'I received messages that sex was best achieved through guile and strategy.'

She was like ‚Äúsee the polygraph means I‚Äôm telling the truth!‚Äù and then lies about knowing how to take a polygraph test.

Polygraph tests are the most inconclusive, inaccurate ways to determine truth. They are not admissible in court, and even if they‚Äôre done completely professionally and without bias (unlikely), there‚Äôs just no way of telling one way or another.

For some reason, there has been a push to falsely label polygraphs as ‚Äúlie detectors‚Äù. There‚Äôs no such thing as a lie detector. They don‚Äôt exist.

The only way to determine truth from lie is through corroborating evidence and hard evidence. In this case, all witnesses corroborate Kavanaugh‚Äôs story that the incidents never happened, including Christine Ford‚Äôs best female friend. The other two women basically admit themselves that they lied, so that‚Äôs even more proof it‚Äôs a hitjob.

Christie Ford is lying, plain and simple. Anybody saying otherwise is being disingenuous and setting a dangerous precedent not dissimilar to what happened in Stalin‚Äôs Soviet Union, Mao‚Äôs China, Pol Pot‚Äôs Cambodia, and Hitler‚Äôs Germany.

"Attorney 'pede here. I'm sure you've all seen the NYT article claiming the Trumps committed tax fraud for decades, and I'm sure the media will make a circus of it. Here's why I think the whole thing is total BS [Long]","I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve all seen the latest NYT **BOMBSHELL ZOMG!!** report that the Trump family used various ‚Äúfraudulent‚Äù and potentially ‚Äúillegal‚Äù gifting techniques to transfer vast sums of wealth from Fred Trump to his children while avoiding gift and estate taxes, and I‚Äôm double-sure the media will make a circus out of it in the coming days and weeks.  The Times makes the case that these dastardly Trumps, for decades, used fraudulent tax strategies to cheat the system, depriving the government of millions upon millions in tax revenue. 

I‚Äôm an estate planning attorney with ~12 years of experience in the field.  I read through the entire NYT article, and I‚Äôm willing to bet that this, much like all of the other various manufactured scandals the media has come up with over the past few years, will amount to absolutely nothing.  The descriptions of the transactions they uncovered in the article practically *scream* to me that the Trumps were using a commonly accepted and widely used estate planning technique that just about anyone in my line of work would know about. 

It‚Äôs called a **FLiP-GRAT.** 

Now, of course, I don‚Äôt have access to all of the gorillions of documents the Times claims they uncovered, and they say the article was the result of a year‚Äôs worth of investigation.  I certainly don‚Äôt have a year‚Äôs worth of time, nor the inclination to dig through everything they‚Äôre claiming, but I‚Äôll do my best to try to briefly explain why I believe this is nothing to bother with because 99% of the population won‚Äôt have any idea what this means otherwise. 

**TL;DR: They used estate planning methods specifically designed to reduce the taxable value of assets so that they didn‚Äôt have to pay a whole bunch of taxes on them, and this is perfectly legal.**  Long version‚Ä¶ 

**FAMILY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP (‚ÄúFLP‚Äù or ‚ÄúFLiP‚Äù):** An FLP is a means of ensuring that an asset you intend to gift to family members is considered to have a lesser value for tax purposes than its actual assessed or appraised value.  In a limited partnership, there are ‚Äúgeneral partner‚Äù interests, and ‚Äúlimited partner‚Äù interests.  The general partner has all of the power to control the entity, and will ideally be the only party in the partnership who could be subject to outside liabilities.  The limited partners have a fractional ownership interest in the entity, but the FLP documents make it abundantly clear that limited partners have no voting rights, and no right to transfer or otherwise alienate their shares of the FLP without the express written permission of the general partner.  Because of the lack of control (no voting power) and the lack of marketability (prohibited alienation) of the limited partner shares, you can declare to the IRS that those interest are worth significantly less than the actual appraised value of the underlying asset. 

Example:  Let‚Äôs say you have an asset worth $100 million, such as - oh I dunno - a large apartment building that could use some work and is not fully rented.  You create an FLP to hold that building, declaring yourself to be a 1% general partner, and 99% limited partner.  Since the limited partnership shares have almost zero control over the operation of the company, you can make the case to the IRS that 99% of the company is *not* worth $99 million, but is worth significantly less, like $50 million.  (The amount of the valuation discount the IRS allows comes down to a case-by-case basis, and depends heavily on how good your lawyers and CPAs are at convincing them.)  At this point, you now have an asset worth $100 million, but if you gift it to family members, you‚Äôre only gifting $50 million for tax purposes. 

**GRANTOR RETAINED ANNUITY TRUST (‚ÄúGRAT‚Äù):** This is the absolute most hated estate planning tool by the greedy Left.  In a GRAT, the Grantor (the person who creates the trust) transfers an asset to the trust, and in exchange receives an annuity payment back from the trust for a certain period of time.  The IRS publishes a table of minimum required interest rates each month that they consider to be presumptively reasonable for arms-length transactions between contracted parties - the Applicable Federal Rate, or AFR.  Through mathematical wizardry (which is beyond my ability, I must admit - I would rely on a CPA for this part), the idea behind the GRAT is to make sure that the value of the annuity you‚Äôre scheduled to receive, at *x*% (no less than AFR) for *y* number of years, is roughly equivalent to the value of the asset you‚Äôre placing in the trust.  In this way, on paper, *you reduce the value of the gift to the trust to the point that the gifted value approaches zero.*  That way, you declare a minimal gift to the IRS, and you don‚Äôt have to deal with gift taxes on that transfer. 

Back to the example above:  You have your $100 million apartment complex in the FLP, and the IRS has accepted your valuation report indicating that the general partner‚Äôs interest is worth $1 million, and the total limited partnership interests are worth $50 million.  Instead of gifting the limited partnership interests directly to your kids, you transfer them to a GRAT with your kids as beneficiaries, then take an annuity payment of *x*% of the initial GRAT value per year for *y* number of years, *so that the total value of your annuity payments received over that period of time is approximately $50 million.*  Voila!  You just transferred $99 million worth of real estate to your kids, and the IRS considers the gift to be worth approximately $0, so you successfully avoid gift/estate taxes.  As an added bonus, the annuity payments back to you are considered income, and you can use any of your available income tax deductions (including business expenses/losses) to reduce your income tax liability each year.  You transformed gift/estate taxes into income tax, which is beneficial because the estate tax rates tend to be insanely higher than income tax rates.  Double bonus: after the GRAT is initially created, the value of the underlying asset (your apartment building) can appreciate in value with no limit, without ever changing the value of the gift you made when you created the GRAT.  It effectively ‚Äúfreezes‚Äù the value of the asset for tax purposes at the moment the transfer is made.  Fix that sucker up, get it fully rented, rake in more income, and get the thing to be worth $600 million a few years later - still doesn‚Äôt trigger any other estate or gift taxes. 

This is not illegal, fraudulent, or unethical in any way.  This is bog standard rich people stuff.  GRATs are so common that the Obama administration specifically targeted them, trying to pass tax legislation that would eliminate or severely restrict them.  I myself have done the FLP portion of this plan before, and I‚Äôm far from the level of expert a billionaire would be hiring to do these things.  On top of that, I can guaran-goddamn-tee that the IRS audited the shit out of these transactions because they‚Äôre so complex and save the taxpayer so much money.  

If I‚Äôm wrong, I‚Äôm wrong, and I‚Äôll admit that LE DRAUMPH is finished.  But I doubt it, and I‚Äôm willing to put that bet in writing and see if it ages well.

Second - it was extremely commonplace for parents to pay their kids a salary back before the loophole closed for doing so in the early 1980s.  This offset the extremely high taxes for example during the Carter years.  

When I was 10,  I paid all the household bills every 2 weeks with the money dad placed in my account.  That was funneled to me as ‚Äúsalary‚Äù and I paid the rate of an independent taxpayer making whatever it was I made.  

This was a well know tax loophole and perfectly legal.  They closed the loophole in the early 80s as I recall.  There was also a kiddie tax loophole that closed in 2008.

CALLING ALL MINNESOTA PEDES! THERE ARE FOUR CRITICAL RACES IN YOUR STATE!,"**IF YOU FUCKING CUCKS HAVEN'T REGISTERED TO VOTE YET, YOU CAN DO IT IN FIVE MINUTES ONLINE**

https://mnvotes.sos.state.mn.us/VoterRegistration/VoterRegistrationMain.aspx


There are four critical races in your state. With solid Republican voter turnout, your state could make the difference in keeping control of Congress.

**Minnesota 2nd:**

[Jason Lewis](https://twitter.com/RepJasonLewis) is the sitting republican congressman. Lewis aligns with Trump on almost all issues. He's what we describe as a **MAGA candidate**. Currently, Lewis is down in the polls, and with typical midterm turnout, we WILL lose this seat unless you bitches get off your asses and vote for him.

**Minnesota 3rd:**

[Erik Paulsen](https://twitter.com/RepErikPaulsen) is the sitting republican congressman. Honestly, he is a bit of a RINO cuck and I can't honestly endorse him, but his voting record is 100% in line with the party, so I'll take him over his opponent, who wants to ""reinstate the assault weapons ban"" and supports the ACA. Dems expect to win this seat in November, so we are playing hard defense on this one.

**Minnesota 7th:**

Collin Peterson is the incumbent Democrat in this seat. His challenger, [Dave Hughes](https://www.hughesforcongress.us/), has been endorsed by Trump and is neck-and-neck in the polls. This is a seat we have a chance of flipping. AKA: **RED WAVE**

**Minnesota 8th:**

This seat is currently held by retiring democrat congressman Rick Nolan. The republican candidate is [Pete Stauber](https://twitter.com/PeteStauber) and he is in dead heat against his democrat opponent. This is another Trump-endorsed candidate and an opportunity for a **YUGE RED WAVE** moment for us. Seriously, if you live in the 8th District and you're not *doing your part*, you are letting down your country and your president.


Minnesota was so close to turning red for Trump in 2016. This is your chance to redeem yourselves. Flip these two seats and defend the other two.

If you think this crap is trivial, consider why the leftist scum spent decades taking over academia along with hollywood and the other cultural centers of production. Was it a lark? Did they do it for the lulz?

No. They did it because places like colleges and movie studios are where powerful cultural weapons are forged. Seriously. This stuff matters.

"Just wrote to my garbage Dem senators about Judge Kavanaugh. Even though they are lost causes, I will not stand by and be silent. Text of what I sent them is inside.","Good afternoon, Senator Markey,

I know that this message will have little to no effect, but I feel it is my civic duty to let you know how thoroughly disappointed I am with the behavior of the Democrats in the Senate throughout the process of Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation.  They have turned this process in to a disgusting smear campaign against a good man, and they are responsible for the hatred and vitriol that both his family and Dr. Ford have received.

The issue of Dr. Ford's increasingly implausible allegations could have been resolved privately last summer, yet the Democrats waited until the most politically expedient time to release them - through leaks to the press, no less.

This is the final straw for me.  I will never donate to or vote for another Democrat as long as the party remains focused on obstruction and double standards.  Where are calls for FBI investigations into Bill Clinton, Cory Booker or Keith Ellison?  All three of these men have much more credible evidence of serious wrongdoing against women, yet there is silence from the left.

Please break with Chuck Schumer and do the right thing by the American people.  Due process is not a throwaway concept; it is a critical pillar upon which our great nation is propped.

"Telling a person they have ""White Privilege"" = Racial Slur/Hate Crime","I am a 32 year old man who descends from a polish immigrant who came to the United States in the 1940‚Äôs. Throughout my upbringing I was taught that skin color is simply a genetic difference like hair color and that as humans we are all the same but might appear slightly different. I have loved people of all racial backgrounds as my own without consciously thinking about it as something to even consider. 

As a child my family had nearly nothing, hungry nights sharing a can of beans or hoping we wouldn‚Äôt get sick from the expired food that should have been thrown away. We didn‚Äôt have clothes from regular stores, only the Salvation Army or Goodwill. In addition, I was the youngest and typically would be relegated to wearing the oversized clothes that my brothers no longer fit into. 

I was sexually abused as a child, by my neighbors. A story I only recently ever told ‚Äúpublicly‚Äù in a recent post here on Reddit. This went on from age five to six until I told my parents about it. The abusing husband and wife duo I believe are still serving time as they had abused many children over the years, for which they were prosecuted. I don‚Äôt tell this story for pity, I tell it because you can come away from being abused without letting it destroy your life. I struggled with this for a while but through my parents church, I had regular counseling (they couldn‚Äôt afford a therapist, and maybe that is for the best). I forgave them (the abusers), I realized that I was fine and moved forward. Occasionally, some of the memories still haunt me, I accept these memories and am thankful that I wasn‚Äôt killed and I have had the opportunity to live a meaningful life. 

I developed gynecomastia (female breasts on male) around age 11. I distinctly remember a sleep over at my best friend‚Äôs house in which I was changing shirts and he pointed and said ‚ÄúWhat are those?‚Äù. The following year at school I became acutely aware of how different I looked compared to the other boys. I got made fun of frequently, the most clear bullying memory is of a boy (who‚Äôs name I will omit) who spit in my hair. The worst though, was when teachers assumed I was a girl and made the error in front of the entire class. In some sense this technically makes me trans-gender since I do have female anatomy components but clearly not the text book definition as a lot of men can develop gynecomastia for different reasons. At a young age though, I was fairly certain that I did in fact have girl ‚Äúboobs‚Äù which was very confusing for me. 

I made friends with the kids in the choir programs and they treated me as one of them, these were my friends. I stuck out the rest of school with a lot less issues and as I got older I started lifting weights and transforming my body to cover up the breast tissue that made me so self-conscious. I worked hard in choir, competed in various competitions, won many of them. My confidence started to rise and I knew that I could be capable of great things. 

After high school I moved out of my parents‚Äô house and was on my own. My parents provided $0.00 in financial support to help me get established on my own. I was 18, with a clunker car, 6 months of insurance paid and no job. I lived in my car and made my way west back to the home town we originally had started in. I got an apartment with a friend from my old school and went out and got a job flipping burgers. 

Eventually, as I realized I lacked direction in my life I decided to serve in the US Navy. I joined as a Master-At-Arms which is the military police arm of the Navy. I enjoyed my time in the Navy and when it was done I returned to the area that I grew up, this time with my parents while I got back on my civilian feet again. My parents were too hard to live with so I quickly moved out into my own place again and got a job as a Security Guard while going to school full time during the day. I couldn‚Äôt afford to pay cash for school and live on my own so I got student loans to cover the cost of my education. I found out, near the end of my program that the type of job I would get as a result would pay about the same as the entry level security job I had already been in. I talked to my boss about this and he suggested that I spend my energy trying to pursue a career in security management. I tried to interview for his role once he was able to be promoted into another role and I failed. I wasn‚Äôt selected and I was devastated. I talked to the group of hiring managers on the interview loop and they all agreed to let me set up follow up meetings for the following few months. I took advantage of their mentorship and within 6 months I was able to nail the interview process and have my first opportunity as a manager. 

Over the course of the next 6 years I worked hard, paid down debt, got married, had children and achieved many accolades for my hard work and dedication. 

Now I have a beautiful home, manageable debt, children starting school and a great marriage. 

Why is my life story of any importance? Simple, because each of us are human. I‚Äôm not a ‚Äúwhite male‚Äù. I am just The\_Zotico. My skin color never helped me, my gender never helped me. My parent‚Äôs church helped me, my friends helped me and I helped me. 

White privilege is not real, it doesn‚Äôt exist. What is most frequently confused is that generational wealth is passed on and due to the count of families with wealth to pass on that happen to be of white skin color. Any family can do this exact same thing and it has NOTHING to do with being white. 

We must fight back against this horrible slur. Today we are afraid to use the ‚ÄúN‚Äù word due to it being considered ‚Äúextremely racist‚Äù even though there are dozens of top 10 songs that have used the word repeatedly. The reason the ‚ÄúN‚Äù word isn‚Äôt acceptable is because it represents a loathsome hate for a human based on only their skin color. ‚ÄúWhite Privilege‚Äù is the same thing, it‚Äôs hateful, dirty and it isn‚Äôt OK to be racially categorized. All people regardless of skin tone need to stand up to any form of racism and people who use ‚Äúwhite privilege‚Äù to describe people are being hateful and racist. 

White Privilege, it is a racist term and unacceptable that we allow racism in our society today. Any person claiming that another has ‚Äú\[race\] privilege‚Äù must be prosecuted for hate crimes so we can move forward with the understanding that skin color DOESN‚ÄôT matter.

"Why ""White Privilege"" is = to the ""N"" word.","  

I am a 32 year old man who descends from a polish immigrant who came to the United States in the 1940‚Äôs. Throughout my upbringing I was taught that skin color is simply a genetic difference like hair color and that as humans we are all the same but might appear slightly different. I have loved people of all racial backgrounds as my own without consciously thinking about it as something to even consider. 

As a child my family had nearly nothing, hungry nights sharing a can of beans or hoping we wouldn‚Äôt get sick from the expired food that should have been thrown away. We didn‚Äôt have clothes from regular stores, only the Salvation Army or Goodwill. In addition, I was the youngest and typically would be relegated to wearing the oversized clothes that my brothers no longer fit into. 

I was sexually abused as a child, by my neighbors. A story I only recently ever told ‚Äúpublicly‚Äù in a recent post here on Reddit. This went on from age five to six until I told my parents about it. The abusing husband and wife duo I believe are still serving time as they had abused many children over the years, for which they were prosecuted. I don‚Äôt tell this story for pity, I tell it because you can come away from being abused without letting it destroy your life. I struggled with this for a while but through my parents church I had regular counseling (they couldn‚Äôt afford a therapist, and maybe that is for the best). I forgave them, I realized that I was fine and moved forward. Occasionally, some of the memories still haunt me, I accept these memories and am thankful that I wasn‚Äôt killed and I have had the opportunity to live a meaningful life. 

I developed gynecomastia (female breasts on male) around age 11. I distinctly remember a sleep over at my best friend‚Äôs house in which I was changing shirts and he pointed and said ‚ÄúWhat are those?‚Äù. The following year at school I became acutely aware of how different I looked compared to the other boys. I got made fun of frequently, the most clear bullying memory is of a boy (who‚Äôs name I will omit) who spit in my hair. The worst though, was when teachers assumed I was a girl and made the error in front of the entire class. In some sense this technically makes me trans-gender since I do have female anatomy components but clearly not the text book definition as a lot of men can develop gynecomastia for different reasons. At a young age though, I was fairly certain that I did in fact have girl ‚Äúboobs‚Äù which was very confusing for me. 

I made friends with the kids in the choir programs and they treated me as one of them, these were my friends. I stuck out the rest of school with a lot less issues and as I got older I started lifting weights and transforming my body to cover up the breast tissue that made me so self-conscious. I worked hard in choir, competed in various competitions, won many of them. My confidence started to rise and I knew that I could be capable of great things. 

After high school I moved out of my parents‚Äô house and was on my own. My parents provided $0.00 in financial support to help me get established on my own. I was 18, with a clunker car, 6 months of insurance paid and no job. I lived in my car and made my way west back to the home town we originally had started in. I got an apartment with a friend from my old school and went out and got a job flipping burgers. 

Eventually, as I realized I lacked direction in my life I decided to serve in the US Navy. I joined as a Master-At-Arms which is the military police arm of the Navy. I enjoyed my time in the Navy and when it was done I returned to the area that I grew up, this time with my parents while I got back on my civilian feet again. My parents were too hard to live with so I quickly moved out into my own place again and got a job as a Security Guard while going to school full time during the day. I couldn‚Äôt afford to pay cash for school and live on my own so I got student loans to cover the cost of my education. I found out, near the end of my program that the type of job I would get as a result would pay about the same as the entry level security job I had already been in. I talked to my boss about this and he suggested that I spend my energy trying to pursue a career in security management. I tried to interview for his role once he was able to be promoted into another role and I failed. I wasn‚Äôt selected and I was devastated. I talked to the group of hiring managers on the interview loop and they all agreed to let me set up follow up meetings for the following few months. I took advantage of their mentorship and within 6 months I was able to nail the interview process and have my first opportunity as a manager. 

Over the course of the next 6 years I worked hard, paid down debt, got married, had children and achieved many accolades for my hard work and dedication. 

Now I have a beautiful home, manageable debt, children starting school and a great marriage. 

Why is my life story of any importance? Simple, because each of us are human. I‚Äôm not a ‚Äúwhite male‚Äù. I am just The\_Zotico. My skin color never helped me, my gender never helped me. My parent‚Äôs church helped me, my friends helped me and I helped me. 

White privilege is not real, it doesn‚Äôt exist. What is most frequently confused is that generational wealth is passed on and due to the count of families with wealth to pass on that happen to be of white skin color. Any family can do this exact same thing and it has NOTHING to do with being white. 

We must fight back against this horrible slur. Today we are afraid to use the ‚ÄúN‚Äù word due to it being considered ‚Äúextremely racist‚Äù even though there are dozens of top 10 songs that have used the word repeatedly. The reason the ‚ÄúN‚Äù word isn‚Äôt acceptable is because it represents a loathsome hate for a human based on only their skin color. ‚ÄúWhite Privilege‚Äù is the same thing, it‚Äôs hateful, dirty and it isn‚Äôt OK to be racially categorized. All people regardless of skin tone need to stand up to any form of racism and people who use ‚Äúwhite privilege‚Äù to describe people are being hateful and racist. 

\[TLDR\]

White Privilege, it is a racist term and unacceptable that we allow racism in our society today. Any person claiming that another has ‚Äú\[race\] privilege‚Äù must be prosecuted for hate crimes so we can move forward with the understanding that skin color DOESN‚ÄôT make people different. It's all about the human, the choices of the human and the path they create for themselves from the situation they started from.",35,2018-10-03 16:54:06,The_Donald,The_Zotico,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/9l2eoo/why_white_privilege_is_to_the_n_word/,/r/The_Donald/comments/9l2eoo/why_white_privilege_is_to_the_n_word/,9l2eoo,*REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!*...Stop wielding your *male privilege* to complain about the term 'white privilege'!,CA[deleted],4,2018-10-03 10:35:55

AMA Announcement! Wednesday 10/3 @ 6pm EDT - Faith Goldy!!!,"[Faith Goldy](http://magaimg.net/img/6bn6.jpg) is an investigative journalist and political commentator making the leap into politics in her bid to become Mayor of Toronto. Her media career has seen her take fearless stances on illegal migration, cultural marxism in education, Jihad creep, and unabashed support for President Donald J Trump. Now, in the face of murder rates higher than NYC and illegal gun crime up almost 200% in the last year alone, Goldy says she's got the tough on crime, easy on taxpayers approach to set Toronto back on the straight and narrow.

How many minorities support trump on this thread?,"I'm a Muslim American, and I've been following trump since the beginning of his campaign, and I have to say, despite how the left portrays him, I honestly see him as a genuinely good person. I'll never forget when I hopped on the trump train; I watched one of his full rally speachs online back in 2015, and somewhere in it he was mentioning fake news. I brushed it off as nonsense, anyways later in the day I see Nowthis posting highlights from that speech on Facebook. Naturally I click the video to recap what I saw, and they were editing the video in such a way that made him say things he didn't say. What he said in the edited version was obviously racist and 'deplorable', but I didn't remember him saying that in the full uncut version of the speech. I rewatched it again only to confirm my earlier suspicions, Nowthis edited the video. I ultimately believed him when he said there was a lot of fake news. I followed his campaign more and more after that little episode and grew to genuinely appreciate his effort in making America great again. I've heard so much bullshit around me saying his only supporters are white supremacists,  and I know that's not true.

We are also one of the most oppressed groups on earth who are slandered and defamed daily by liberals simply because we are white.  They have blamed us for nearly all the problems on planet earth and we are getting tired of it.

Let me explain with a brief economic lesson for the youngins. How much is the $100 dollar bill in my pocket worth at the moment? The answer is $100. How much will that same $100 bill be worth in a year? The answer is still $100.

However, if I take that $100 dollar bill and invest that money by buying one $100 share of stock in XYZ company, how much will that $100 dollars be
 worth in a year? The answer is what ever the price of 1 share of XYZ common stock is worth. If the company experienced a whopping 50% massive growth due to Pres Trump's  BOOMING economy, that $100 will now be worth $150.


So what is the moral of this story?

2) The New York Times is very fake news because if that money was never invested, the value of those assets would not have magically increased.",CA[deleted],1,2018-10-03 14:07:04

NYSlimes BS Trump Tax Hit Piece Tries to Paint Trump as Lousy Businessman who relied on Much Inherited Money. It is BS Here's WHY.,"Hit Piece:

'The president has long sold himself as a self-made billionaire, but a Times investigation found that he received at least $413 million in today‚Äôs dollars from his father‚Äôs real estate empire, much of it through tax dodges in the 1990s.'

http://archive.is/F18yi#selection-377.0-377.235

Reality: 

Trump tuned his dad's $40M company into a BILLION DOLLAR COMPANY in 15 Years.

Read it and Weep, NYT:

NYTimes 1983 : 'Fifteen years ago, he joined his father's business, an empire of middle-class apartment houses in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island then worth roughly $40 million. Today, the Trump Organization controls assets worth about $1 billion.'

http://archive.is/Dq0p

1973:'‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs site was the only one that was all ready to go,‚Äù Mr. Kaiser recalled. ‚ÄúI was about to go on vacation to Europe to visit my parents when I called him up and said, where will it be? ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs my site,‚Äô he said. ‚ÄòYou can bank on it.‚Äô'

http://archive.is/YrqIL

'The Trump touch. It has set some people in New York to outright Trump worship; they call him 'a real-estate genius' who has helped lead the city out of the darkness of the mid-1970's into a new era of glamour and excitement. '

''He has the uncanny ability to smell blood in the water,' a competitor says. He obtained the air rights over Tiffany, which allowed him to build a much higher building, and went to Equitable, which sold him the land for a 50 percent interest in the project.'

'For a billion-dollar corporation, there aren't too many people around....   ..Fred Trump's empire, which he built from scratch, had an estimated value of $40 million when Donald joined the business 16 years ago.'

'The couple's attention to detail is exceptional. Workmen at the Trump Plaza say that on a recent visit, Mr. Trump spotted a hairline crack that others could barely detect in a bathroom of one of the 140 cooperative apartments. He not only complained but stood there until a work crew came and replaced the marble.'

''He is an almost unbelievable negotiator,' says Irving Fischer of HRH Construction. 'I don't worship at the shrine of Donald Trump,' he says, 'but our company has given up trying to negotiate costs with him. We just say: 'Tell us what you want, you're going to get it anyway.'''

' 'He has an uncanny sense of knowing that something is a good deal when it looks dismal to everyone else.''

'Donald Trump is the Michael Jackson of real estate,' says Mr. Fischer. 'We've been dealing with him since he was 16. He was an old trouper at age 25.''

"There are a lot of people in the world who are simply followers or late adopters... (related to how we proceed to further annihilate our political enemies / the enemies of America, and get our way)","There are a lot of people who will never come to MAGA until it's 1) safe, and 2) the default ""cool"" position.  These are the types of people who were swayed relatively late in the game by the SJW, cultural communism, everything-should-be-government-controlled bologna.  These people take a long time to follow something, not because they're independent thinkers, but because they want to be with what they perceive as the safe ""in"" crowd.  They may or may not be aware of this.  Most aren't.

These people will never be swayed by holes in their logic being pointed out or by common decency showing they are in the wrong.  They will only be swayed by being decidedly shown that they are officially part of the uncool crowd that is lagging behind the culture.

I am posting this because there are some people in my life who fall in this category, and imagine a lot of you have them too.  They exasperate me.  They are immune to red pills because they are just following the herd, almost on purpose.  Things that show flaw in their choice of direction are ignored completely or deemed ""not important""... for no reason other than to sweep it under the proverbial rug.

Now my point is that the only way we can win these people, and thus become such the decidedly noted majority in the country... unable to be hidden even by the misleadia... and shaping our cultural and economic future for at least a generation... is to completely ANNIHILATE the Democrats in midterms.

It's not enough just to not lose.  We need to show up in numbers that make it impossible for even the misleadia to cover up what's happening in American culture on the ground.  We need to provably and undeniably show these followers that they are NOT up on what's acceptable cool culture in this country.

It's nine o'clock at night, and as I watch out the window, a sheriff's car slowly drives past my home. I am grateful that they have offered to do extra patrols, as someone just posted our home address, and Rand's cell number, on the internet -- all part of a broader effort to intimidate and threaten Republican members of Congress and their families. I now keep a loaded gun by my bed. Our security systems have had to be expanded. I have never felt this way in my life.


In the last 18 months, our family has experienced violence and threats of violence at a horrifying level. I will never forget the morning of the shooting at the congressional baseball practice, the pure relief and gratitude that flooded me when I realized that Rand was okay.



He was not okay last November, when a violent and unstable man attacked him from behind while he was working in our yard, breaking six ribs and leaving him with lung damage and multiple bouts of pneumonia. Kentucky's secretary of state, Alison Lundergan Grimes, recently joked about it in a speech. MSNBC commentator Kasie Hunt laughingly said on air that Rand's assault was one of her ""favorite stories."" Cher, Bette Midler, and others have lauded his attacker on Twitter. I hope that these women never have to watch someone they love struggle to move or even breathe for months on end.


Earlier this week, Rand was besieged in the airport by activists ""getting up in his face,"" as you, Senator Booker, encouraged them to do a few months ago. Preventing someone from moving forward, thrusting your middle finger in their face, screaming vitriol -- is this the way to express concern or enact change? Or does it only incite unstable people to violence, making them feel that assaulting a person is somehow politically justifiable?


Senator Booker, Rand has worked with you to co-sponsor criminal justice reform bills. He respects you, and so do I. I would call on you to retract your statement. I would call on you to condemn violence, the leaking of elected officials' personal addresses (our address was leaked from a Senate directory given only to senators), and the intimidation and threats that are being hurled at them and their families.


Sincerely,
Kelley Paul",CA[deleted],10,2018-10-03 19:39:22

The Democratic Party has permanently lost my support,"I've always thought of myself as something of a conservative, although I have never voted for a Republican for President (voted Johnson in 2016 because Hillary has always rubbed me the wrong way since the 90s, but I voted twice for Obama).  I've voted for a smattering of Rs and Ds each election, after looking up each candidate's policies and hearing them speak (or at least seeing something written by them).

After what the Democratic Party did to Brett Kavanaugh and his family, I am never voting D again.  Even if I like the person with a D next to their name.  If I hate the R in that race I am just going to abstain.

To win back my good graces the Democrats would, at the very least, have to issue an extremely public apology to the judge, his family, and the American people, kick out the individuals behind the debacle (at the very least Feinstein and Booker), and promise to practice politics with integrity from this moment forward.  I would need to judge the apology to be sincere.

Until that happens, there will never be another Democrat vote from me as long as I live.

Students Demand Professor Be Fired After He Champions Due Process, Says ‚ÄòAccusers Sometimes Lie‚Äô

Nearly 100 students at the University of Southern California attended a rally at noon on Monday demanding a tenured professor be fired after he sent a reply-all email last Thursday to the student body noting that ‚Äúaccusers sometimes lie.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf the day comes you are accused of some crime or tort of which you are not guilty, and you find your peers automatically believing your accuser, I expect you find yourself a stronger proponent of due process than you are now,‚Äù emailed Professor James Moore.

The email ‚Äî in response to a reply-all email that urged students to ‚ÄúBelieve Survivors‚Äù on the day of Christine Ford‚Äôs testimony ‚Äî triggered what one school admin said was ‚Äúhundreds‚Äù of emails from concerned students and alumni since Thursday.

USC students Audrey Mechling and Joelle Montier then organized a Facebook rally against the engineering professor, entitled ‚ÄúTimes Up for James Moore.‚Äù Monday at noon at the USC Argue Plaza, nearly 100 students yelled, ‚ÄúTimes Up, No Moore!‚Äù dozens of times.

Roughly 7 students also spoke at a makeshift podium, sharing sharing stories of sexual abuse. The crowd then marched over to the office of Dean Jack Knott, according to multiple live-streams of the protest.""",CA[deleted],1,2018-10-04 15:11:32

I mean for fucks sake man.

Google / Android might as well be a platformed designed specially to spy on you. Literally everything you do with google is data mined and centrally stored. 

Facebook has pioneered big data psychological profiling of all 2 billion users plus the tapping into of the supplemental data feeds (SDF to be discussed further down).  They have like a 14k point psychological profile on each user and can network human behavior like nothing else can.  The literal evolution of DARPA‚Äôs lifelog.

Microsoft and Yahoo are open doors for the national security infrastructure.  

Amazon is getting into this spying with alexia microsphones in your house, car, etc.

Twitter is just a rude trailer park boy who has fun denying conservatives a means to speak.  Prob also spyware with microphone and camera access.  

Then you have these supplemental data feeds from shopping and internet browsing and tv watching from companies like time warner, Comcast, Verizon‚Äôs Oath.com (AOL, Yahoo, Huff Post, etc).  That combine your data with Facebook.

Peter Theil‚Äôs Plantir is a private company that taps each of these sources and sends it all to the NSA.  Literally named after the all seeing eye from the lord of the rings books.

Apple stores all customer data on your device.  You have control over what apps can access what data.  It anonymizes payments, it protects your location data, it takes great pains to secure your biometrics and password to the point Apple can‚Äôt even crack your phone.  I suppose you could argue the feds can access your iCloud data and have a back door but nothing has leaked on this like has occurred at other companies.  Your emails from iCloud and I messages are encrypted to an insane degree and only stored on the device as opposed to a central server. I‚Äôm not even sure Apple can respond to a warrant for your iCloud data.  

I mean let‚Äôs put this in perspective.

"If you own GE stock (General Electric), you are supporting China more than USA.","GE loves 'supporting' China : https://www.ge.com/cn/sites/www.ge.com.cn/files/GE_in_China_fact_sheet_EN_0811.pdf

Meanwhile, a lot of USA Boomers are invested in GE, while it slashes your dividends in half, loses billions of dollars off the balance sheet, surprise ejects the CEO.

The bump up in GM stock is not because of a possible turn around due to a new 'proper' CEO... it is because of USMCA or NAFTA 2.0 or whatever its called. 

OCT.1, GE was not the only company to spike.

MG, Magna also spiked, and in my opinion MG is a much better company that supports the North American economies. It has double the Dividends, and is the worlds largest automotive part supplier.

While GE helps china build solar, build renewables.

Magna seeks to PROFIT off China by manufacturing and selling LUXURY electric vehicles to the Chinese market (which already surpasses sales by Tesla).

China has 500 EV companies, and not a single one is allowed to have their own factory. Magna will swoop right in and make an buttload of profit in the coming years for NA.

Will it put a wrench in Tesla? Possibly, since Tesla is having trouble supplying the Chinese demand for EV, let alone local demand.

Do whatever you want though. Full disclosure, I have GE puts that will expire worthless tomorrow. I don't expect GE to crash, but I also don't want those who were thinking of ""going to cash"" before Oct.1, having their minds changed by this sort of manufactured up-swing.

Liberal Tolerance On Display In Here Folks! Get It While It's Hot!!,"So an old ""friend"" of mine posted earlier today, attacking Brett Kavanaughs ""qualifications"" for the role as a SC Justice.  He cited his lack of experience as a trial lawyer, and lack of experience as a prosecutor.  He also incorrectly insinuated Kavanaugh was not ranked WQ by the ABA. (He is)

I replied respectfully, that neither of those things are required for the role as a SCOTUS Judge doesn't litigate, they review cases and interpret law.  I added that he was the first person I knew that questioned his qualifications, and suggested that even Democratic Senators had not questioned his qualifications.  I made it clear that to many Americans, including myself, Kavanaugh represents a judge that will bring traditional conservative views to the court and constitutional originalist interpretation of the law which we yearn for.  I added, in deference, that if he wanted to question Kavanaughs temperament or that if he wanted to believe uncorroborated allegations that was one thing - but to question his actual legal qualifications was silly. 

Moments later I recieved the following...

He's unfriended me, and deleted my original comment as well.  Why is it, I am always up for debate and open discussion, but leftists run and hide and hurl insults and foul language?  Naturally, he's a soyboy from LA and a Music Major...

I've been saying a lot about it professionally for years.  We need our manufacturing local for a lot of reasons, reasons that should fit literally everyone's motivations:

- China and other third-world countries use what effectively amounts to slave labor.  If you want muh fair wages and muh safe working conditions, stuff needs to be made here.

- Companies operating in China and other third-world countries have no regard for the health and safety of their employees or the cities they operate in, nor do they care for the environment.  If you want to stop world pollution, stuff needs to be made in countries where they care about it, like the USA.

- Stuff made in China gets shipped around the world.  If you care about reducing fossil fuel use and stopping global warming, manufacturing needs to be done closer to the end point wherever it's reasonable.

- The Chinese are well-known intellectual property thieves. While they don't directly rip off designs, they'll take product samples and ""cleanly"" reverse-engineer them -- that is, one engineering team takes the thing apart and develops a set of requirements, and another team takes the requirements and creates a product.  Easily a complete knock-off product without directly stealing the intellectual property.  You want your secrets safe?  Make in America.

- In the event of war, anything of any strategic importance needs to be possible to make without dealing with a potential enemy or exposing the goods through vulnerable places like the oceans.",CA[deleted],1,2018-10-04 15:22:09

New Dem ad strategy. WARN YOUR CONSERVATIVE FRIENDS!,"I have run into a couple of ads made to look as if they're funded by conservatives which basically say that establishment Republicans aren't working hard enough to push Trump's agenda and we need to vote against them for that.

Every vote counts so if you hear anyone talking like this or mentioning these ads explain to them what is going on.

I was accused of being a racist at the gym for turning a guy down today. Wondering when it became okay to use your ‚Äúvictim‚Äù status to bully others (rant).,"Today a Middle Eastern American man came up to me at the gym (after blatantly staring at me for 15 minutes) and asked me to go on a date with him. I very politely told him I had a boyfriend, and he snapped at me telling me ‚Äúyeah, I‚Äôm sure it has nothing to do with the fact my skin isn‚Äôt white.‚Äù I turned to walk away and he followed me through the gym shaking his head before he barked ‚Äúracist‚Äù at me and stormed away. It was very embarrassing in front of everyone at the gym. I reported him to the girl at the desk but who knows what that will do.

It really shook me up but it got me thinking about everything going on with Kavanaugh and how quickly everyone is ready to persecute him due to jumping on board to protect the women‚Äôs victim status (I‚Äôve seen many posts elsewhere recently about how women have it so much harder so no one should feel bad for even the POSSIBILITY that he‚Äôs being falsely accused). I‚Äôm just wondering when this shifted to completely acceptable. It‚Äôs nothing new that dems try to divide everyone up into their own victim boxes through identity politics, but had DT not been elected President, it seems we would have been headed toward guilty until proven innocent across the board where Hollywood and the media get to decide everyone‚Äôs morals (and white men = bad, obviously). It is literally ‚Äúreverse racism‚Äù or reverse discrimination when someone uses their own victimization to assume they know everything about you because of what you look like.

Only one side blocks traffic and destroys cities
Only one side launches endless and merciless physical attacks on others for political differences
Only one side is shooting up baseball fields
Only one side chases speakers off college campuses
Only one side engages in complete character assassination based on zero facts
Only one side attempts to get you fired and ruin your life over political differences 
Only one side hates America
Only one side hates law enforcement 
Only one side hates an improving economy 
Only one side hates the idea of borders to protect our unique country and cultural values
Only one side is encouraging harassment of their political opponents 
Only one side is mailing ricin and other suspicious powders to members of the opposite party
Only one side is deathly allergic to a different opinion

Only one side is causing the destruction and divisiveness that we find ourselves in today because Hollywood, their professors, and the TV told them to be filled with hate. They want to tear down this country, and the other side is trying to fight back to save it!

I remember the day that Bernie lost...,"I had attended Bernie's speech in my town.

I solemnly walked to my polling place, and cast my vote for Bernie even though my state (CA) was firmly in Hillary's clutches.

I walked into my shitty little apartment, in my dirty work clothes, went to my dad's room and cried.

I cried because back then, I wanted the world to be different.

I wanted the world to be saved.

I wanted to be saved from my shitty life.

When election day came, I didn't vote.

When they announced Trump as the winner, I wasn't surprised.

It was a given in mind.

""That's what you fucking get, you corrupt pieces of shit."" 

You see, when Bernie lost, something snapped in me.

The corruption of the DNC, the election fraud, the lies from the left, the *disregard* and the ridicule I received from ""my side"" for voting for Bernie burned me.

It burned away the weak cuck inside of me.

I remember closing my eyes, tears streaming down my face, with gritted teeth and clenched fist.

That day, I discovered the truth of the world:

Life isn't fair.

If you want life to be fair to you.

You need to *make it fair.*

I realized that if an ""idiot"" like Trump could become president, what the fuck was my excuse?

I was always told by my pop that I could be someone great, *if I just put out the effort.*

**""My greatest fear, son, isn't that you'll fail. It's that you'll succeed at being mediocre.""**

***

I woke up that day.

I discovered /r/theredpill.

I was done waiting for handouts.

I was done waiting for my government to fix my problems.

I was tired of being a useful idiot.

Tired of being shamed for my gender.

Tired of being shamed for my sexuality.

Tired of being shamed for my skin color.

Tired of being shamed for my views.

Tired of being taken for granted by the Leftists.

***

Be the change you want to see in the world.

Nothing in life is free.

I don't want anyone's pity.

Because I love my life now.

I love my life, and my full-time job is being a professional ass-wiper for my bedridden father in a trailer park out in the boonies.

I learned to be brave that day.

How am I brave?

Because I support Trump now.

When a Leftist tries to lecture me in real life about the world, in public, I smile and only have one reply:

""MAGA.""

And I walk away.

Trump showed me that you don't have to be the smartest man in the room.

You don't have to be the strongest man in the room.

You don't have to be the most charming man in the room.

You don't have to be the best looking man in the room.

The only thing a man needs to have is the biggest set of balls in whichever room he's in-

-and the vision to *get shit done* instead of licking the boots of the globalist scum running shit behind the scenes.

A man's greatest gift is his commitment.

A man's greatest weapon is his ability to walk away.

Trump has committed to America, and he can walk away from the Leftist lunatics that are attempting to subjugate Americans.

The left constantly points to Trump's failures in his life.

His divorces.

His bankruptcies.

His life.

You know what I see?

#I see a man who never quit.

It doesn't matter how many times you get knocked down.

What matters is if you get back up and keep moving forward.

How much shit you can take, and keep moving forward.

That's how winning is done.

Keep winning, President Trump.

I'm with you.

MAGA.

We are not *nearly* enraged enough, but sir, the enlightenment is unprecedented. Judge Kavanaugh, what YOU have endured has made OUR Constitution that much stronger, because decent people, *everywhere*, are compelled to repudiate what has happened to you here. Politically disinterested, but still with eyes and ears, these Americans are *mortified*, sir. They didn't realize which side they were on. Now, they do. The side of merit, of the sort that you have tirelessly earned. You are part of a sacred American tradition now; Abraham Lincoln would wink at you, and George Washington would be honored shaking your hand.

I figured out Renate Alumni.,"So one thing I've been noodling is the Renate Alumni thing.  Of all of Kavanaugh's testimony and all the accusations against him, I've always thought this was the closest to holding any water.  It would be regrettable, if believable, that a bunch of teenage guys wanted to immortalize their sexual conquests in a yearbook, and Kav seemed a little dodgy on that question.  Not like he was lying (looking at you, Swetnick NBC interview), but more like he was showing a little political evasiveness for a topic he didn't want to explain fully.

But the left's line doesn't pass the smell test.  If this girl were the town slut, if you'll permit my falling back into 80's vernacular, then why would they make a big deal of it?  Sure, they'd brag in the locker room, give a few high fives, make some jokes here and there.  But you're not going to form a fucking secret club over the town bike.  A club with positions and titles.  Once everyone had slept with this girl, what would be the point?  There'd be no reason to waste energy thinking about it.  Guys - do you get worked up about some girl you've already slept with, or do you get worked up about some girl you'd like to sleep with?  Gals - I don't know if you experience anything similar.  If not, ask your guy friends.

No, you form a secret club for the girl that you and your friends all idolize, but see as basically unattainable.  At least, sexually unattainable.  Maybe they each managed to get a date, and I don't doubt that they all thought she was a great girl.  Maybe a few of them were looking to score, but inevitably got shot down by the Catholic ideal - ""I'm saving myself for marriage.""  Some Catholic girls really *were* like this.  Billy Joel even wrote a song about it.

Anyway, they liked her, but none of them had managed to get anywhere with her sexually, so they formed a club.  It's a dorky thing that guys do in Catholic and other all-boy high schools.  It probably seems unfamiliar to anyone who went to a coed high school, but the dynamics are just different in single-gender schools.  Same-sex schools enormously reduce the natural mating pressure.  Without potential mates present to see everything you do, everyone can let down their hair, and afford to look a bit silly.  Now I'm not saying that everything everyone does in a coed school is part of the mating ritual, but I am saying that everything that goes on in a coed school is, consciously or not, briefly examined with the question, ""will this make me look stupid in front of girls?""

There were one or two girls my friends and I idolized in school, and spent a lot of time speculating about.  None of them would have anything to do with us.  Or maybe they would have, but we were too chicken to find out.  That Kav and his friends weren't players is actually supported by his beach letter.  ""I think we are unanimous that any girls we can beg to stay there are welcomed with open...""  Beg?  Unanimous?  These are guys who talked a lot about girls, but never got anywhere with them.  And I suspect Renate was the girl they talked about the most, and got the least from.",25,2018-10-05 04:02:16,The_Donald,rothbard_anarchist,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/9lim5n/i_figured_out_renate_alumni/,/r/The_Donald/comments/9lim5n/i_figured_out_renate_alumni/,9lim5n,Makes sense.,CA[deleted],4,2018-10-04 20:39:04

I was victim to a witch hunt, in a similar manner to Trump. Although not a single person knew about it, and I had zero rights. Anyways, I need to go make something to eat, but I will copy and paste my attempted post below.

&#x200B;

Have a good night my friends,

&#x200B;

\-------

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I have a few thoughts to share if anyone has a moment, honestly I would appreciate someone to share my story with . It's been a longtime coming, for all 25 years of my life I have had an tremendously hard time pretty much talking to anyone about anything emotional. I have all these thoughts in my head that are building up and they are destroying my ability to think clearly. I believe the medical disorders cover too wide of an area to diagnose myself with one, or claim to have ""something"". That doing said I have a incredibly strong presence of 75% of the indicators for OCD. This is my first time even mentioning this to anyone, anyways, now thats out of the way. 

&#x200B;

My fellow Americans I say this,

&#x200B;

I truly believe we are at the biggest turning points this world has ever seen, and in addition one of the top turning points in our nations history. I say this due to how quickly we are changing the world around us, the weapons we have developed and the problems now revealed from our luxuries we have enjoyed.Only to name a few

&#x200B;

Our nation must remained unified as we support the principles and foundations that our nation was built on in these strange times.

&#x200B;

Perhaps my most important realization over the past 25 years is that evil exists in the world. The most brazen and recent trend is for evil doers to hide under the guide of their so called ""liberalism"". Of course I am not talking about liberals. I consider myself to be a liberal foremost. Please do not let a group of outsiders drive a wedge between the good people of this world.  

&#x200B;

Definition ---

&#x200B;

Liberalism --- A political theory founded on the natural goodness of humans and the autonomy of the individual and favoring civil and political liberties, government by law with the consent of the governed, and protection from arbitrary authority.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Wow, that what a great definition. First time reading that one myself. 

&#x200B;

Which of our politicians believe in liberty? In the natural goodness of people?(Surely our members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, right???) Those who have attempted to usurp our country and our principles must be exposed. 

&#x200B;

My friends, it is as simple as the movies. It is exactly like the tales of our ancestors. From Beowulf to Starwars, evil exists in the world. Evil comes in as many forms as life itself, it can be ugly, beautiful, painful, blissful, joyful or just pure hateful. 

&#x200B;

And just like in the stories there are truly evil people that run the show, and then there are those that are weak and fall victim to temptation. The great news is that when evil is exposed, evil is weak. 

&#x200B;

When Confronted directly, head on,{Applied directly to the forehead} evil falls apart in the face of righteousness. Evil finds comfort in the darkness and in the absence of knowledge - Evil is at home in the shadow.

&#x200B;

Thankfully we have flashlights! I feel it, we are progressing forward and with that the shadow is recessing.  That being said, evil is deceitful and cruel.  Keep your friends, family, allies and assets close to you, because no one is in this alone.

&#x200B;

You are doing a great job, we all are. Every day and every action we take counts towards the endgame, and our final days. Never underestimate your power, and our power together. 

&#x200B;

Great work and continue the good fight. Help your fellow man, even if it means just being nice, or a simple smile. We must convert those who have been lead astray, and crush the will of those who corrupt.  This fight transcends all boundaries and social constructs, politics of course included.

&#x200B;

"Let's shine a spotlight on House and Senate Races that are supposedly ""Safe D's"", and turn them upside-down!!!","We all know the red wave is happening November 6th. With Democrats having to defend a majority of their senate seats, GOP fundraising and approval ratings at an all-time high, and President Trump having done more in two years than most Presidents have in 8, Republican success is all but assured.

But I want more than that. I don't want just success. I want DOMINANCE. I want a 2/3rds majority in both the house and senate, which combined with SCOTUS and White House control, means the ability to vote on, pass, and sign legislation that will not only fulfill all of President Trump's campaign promises, but put a literal stake in the heart of the Democratic party and perhaps eliminate the very concept of liberalism as well.

For that to happen, it won't be easy. There's a lot of races for House and Senate seats that are all but called for their Democratic incumbent, because the oft-cucked GOP's leadership only cares about races they think are possible to win. To which I say - SCREW THAT.  ALL RACES CAN BE WON. And it's time to take a close look at those races, and turn these supposedly assured victories into crushing defeats!

Let's start with a personal favorite of mine, Paul Tonko of the 20th Congressional district which covers most of New York's upstate Capital Region, [who looks like that douchebag professor who failed your essay in college](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Paul_Tonko_114th_Congress_photo.jpg)

Tonko is yet another career politician who has made a career of Soros-grade progressivism. He's ranked about the top 20 most liberal members of Congress, and you can pretty much guess his positions without me saying them. Against Tax cuts. For unchecked borders and crime. Cares little about blue collar workers while promulgating identity politics. Wants to keep guns out of law-abiding Americans' hands. Pro-Baby Murder while being a Roman Catholic (I STILL don't understand what mental illness you have to have in order to have that opinion). Unfortunately, he's quite popular - despite most of Upstate NY being the only part of the state not made up of complete morons, the Albany area is surprisingly purple, and knowing this, the Democrat-controlled NY Assembly gerrymandered the heck out of the district, moving Tonko to a much more favorable area.

Now let's look at his opponent, Joe Vitollo. A real man's man [(Just look at that bowtie!)](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/960869736253919232/NBZnumw0_400x400.jpg) Vitollo has no political experience and is a registered nurse. He has seen first-hand the destruction caused to the medical industry by Obamacare, and wants to bring an end to the corrupt politicians like Tonko who have let it run abated for far too long. He's 100% MAGA, 100% behind Trump, and 100% politically incorrect. [Here's his Twitter.

"Remember----this is a Battle, not a War.","TL;DR: Have faith. This is a battle, not a war. We are winning on all fronts and have multiple avenues to get our 5th Conservative Justice on the Bench. 

---


The 2016 election was a War. It was the First War. The Second is 2020. 

Democrats have chosen a hill to die on. With all the acrimony against Trump, they are treating this like their last stand. 

But take note----Kavanaugh's confirmation is only a battle, not a war. 

Let's think of contingencies-----as Conservatives, we still have 2 routes available for getting a Justice in if the Senate does not get 50 votes for Kavanaugh. 

**PLAN 1** Between Wed. Oct. 10th and Jan 3rd is 85 days. If Kavanaugh wasn't confirmed, Trump would likely nominate a new Justice by the 10th. The new Senate takes their seats on Jan. 3rd. We have 85 days to confirm the new appointment. Remember, it's been 80 something days for Kavanaugh's appointment so far. 

**PLAN 2** We kick ass on Nov. 6th. Even Dems are starting to see that they woke us up. Conservatives are not happy and don't like to see our system and principals upended like this. Expect great Conservative turnout and Democrat complacency if the Kavanaugh confirmation fails.

Your email address is an identifier. It used to be just your name, DOB and SSN, but it‚Äôs MUCH more than that now. It‚Äôs your IP address, your MAC address, device identifier (UDID, IFA, IFV, Google ID, what have you), etc.

What‚Äôs terrifying is that advertisers partner with adtech companies like Placed, Inc (now a Snap, Inc. company). and PlaceIQ and give them adstreams with IP addresses. So using the location data from apps like Snap, getting cross-platform data from tracking pixels in emails and websites, and more, companies know when you saw an ad, who saw the ad, what other ads they saw, and whether they visited a brick-and-mortar after they saw the ad and then build models to determine the effectiveness of an online or even offline ad (they even measure [how effective your billboard is](https://streetfightmag.com/2016/02/03/with-new-attribution-feature-placed-can-tell-whether-your-billboard-is-hot-or-not/)

No customer information was affected. We take customer privacy very seriously.‚Äù

Either way, having equipment that will be used for national security/defense manufactured in what is essentially a hostile nation is just insane. The military got lambasted years ago for buying American flags made in China. I think that companies that are crucially important to our economy, and who provide support for our military and intelligence community should be held to at least the same standard. 

If we can‚Äôt possibly do it here, we have to at least move it to a friendly nation.

"If your belief system requires you lie to defend it, your belief system is crap.","We all know the example of Taqiyya among Muslims, where Muslims are encouraged to lie about being Muslim if they feel they might be persecuted for being Muslim, but what made me think of this is the way Democrats are treating Kavanaugh.  They're using lies to attack him, because they feel they need to, to defend their values.  They feel they're defending Roe v. Wade, for example.  I support people defending their values.  In fact, I'm not even against legalized abortion, if the woman feels strongly about wanting an abortion.  But if you have to tell lies to defend these values, then perhaps the values aren't worth defending?  This relates to the whole so-called ""resistance.""  The whole thing is one big passive/aggressive campaign of lies, where nothing that comes out of a Democrat's mouth comes from an honest place.  No offense to women, but it seems like a stereotypically feminine fighting strategy, where your wife burns your dinner, and pretends it was an accident, just to make you angry.  The whole idea of having a Republic is that we assume that people who open their mouths in public are speaking freely about what they really believe.  If your strategy is Taqiyya, you are not representing the values needed to build a Republic.",10,2018-10-05 21:30:36,The_Donald,storona_govyadiny,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/9lpxcy/if_your_belief_system_requires_you_lie_to_defend/,/r/The_Donald/comments/9lpxcy/if_your_belief_system_requires_you_lie_to_defend/,9lpxcy,CB[deleted],CA[deleted],CS[deleted],2018-10-05 13:39:54

"Secret Trump supporter, lifetime democrat. Voting republican in the mid-terms for the first time after the Kavanaugh disgrace.","Hey TD.

Full disclosure, last election I voted for Gary Johnson, and before that I voted 2x for Obama.

I live in the great (swing) state of Michigan and come from a long line of pro-union automotive and construction workers. In my family we voted democrat to protect unions, and that was just the way it was. 

Then the democrats stopped pretending to care about people like us.

When I was a kid, my grandparents had always talked about Trump in a positive way. When I went to the beach and wanted money for ice cream, they would joke, ‚ÄúWho do you think I am, Donald Trump?‚Äù. I remember seeing him doing interviews with Larry King and Phil Donahue when I was a little kid, and he was always positive and always talked about a better future for America.

The Kavanaugh hearing and rape accusations finally pushed us all solid right. I called my dad to talk about it and he was already disgusted. He has 3 sons, he knew that could have been me up there.

I‚Äôve been a secret Trump supporter over the last year or so, and some of my comments have been linked here for dropping truth bombs on the rest of reddit. That‚Äôs over, because I was recently banned from r.news and r.politics for saying some *inconvenient facts*.

Michigan loves Trump, and we are behind him the whole way. I have more hope for this state than I ever have, but only if we get out there and continue to make it happen.

MEME MAGIC FRIDAY: SLOW AND STEADY EDITION,"#GREETINGS CENTIPEDES!

**Welcome back to another Meme Magic Friday! As usual I am your host, Crusader, and humble meme farmer /u/D4rkd3str0yer.** 


**Our sponsor this week is Bold Text! Bold Text: Same great text, just higher energy. We are also sponsored this week by Beer. Not that feminist Bud Light shit, I'm talking real, American beer, Yuengling. Drank by Chadvanaughs everywhere!**

**It has been quite a few weeks! Old enemies became allies, old allies stepped up to the plate, the GEOTUS cucked Canada, and I realized that no, I am not, in fact, tired of winning (for those of you who are tired of winning, I hear /r/The_Mueller is accepting mod applications).**

**Who could have predicted the turnaround of [LINDSAY FUCKING GRAHAM](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/491453197336969225/497840830229250049/rif-1538764874448.jpg)? His epic [BTFO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKSRUK-l7dM) of the Democratic ""Senators"" was on the level of ""You'd be in jail"". After hearing that smackdown I had an immediate overpowering impulse to go to my fridge and shotgun a beer in honor of Judge Kavanaugh. Truly some powerful stuff folks. Then Kanye, Yeezy himself, BTFO'd Democrats on their home turf on SNL. Keenan Thompson was so butthurt that he bitched about not being able to criticize Trump and disagree...on SNL. I suppose since no one watches SNL anymore (Sad!) he thought it was the equivalent of being deplatformed? Steven Crowder (Who is having an AMA on your favorite domreddit, Tuesday at 6PM EST) [revealed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6dv6G1FWxk) that TCU actually stands for ""Triggered Cuck University"" and actually made them [admit](https://i.redd.it/jgtwpeny26q11.png) that they think *their own campus* has a rape problem. Next up, Boss Turntle (the namesake of this edition of MMF) himself Mitch McConnell. Clearly he's doing something right, since the [Fake](http://archive.is/dips2) [News](http://archive.is/RPI6s) [Media](http://archive.is/AW8bx) has once again started writing hitpieces on our reptilian majority leader. And finally, Senator Orrin Hatch absolutely [ended](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/9lgboz/orrin_hatch_handles_a_protester/) a group of protestors, shooing them off like the gadflies they are and telling them what their parents are thinking: ""Grow up"".**

**To close this week, we'll take a look at some sportsball.

I've been slowly red pilling my best friend from childhood,"We've been friends since middle school, and we are pretty opposite politically. We agree on most other things and get along great. He is registered as an independent, but really is mostly a democrat.

But since Trump was elected and the MSM attacks him 99% of all news stories (even ignoring massive wildfires or almost anything else just to attack Trump)...I show him news stories the MSM made in the past that contradict what they say now.

For example, the current news with Kavanaugh, I pointed out to my friend that its a witch hunt like they used to do in the old times. People in mass gathering to attack someone, but with no evidence or proof what so ever. He started to argue, but then I pointed out that the same thing happens with the democrats and that is equally wrong without proof or anything but allegations. 

I showed him a story of allegations against Hillary Clinton who someone said was abusive but without evidence, which made him stop arguing and move on to other topics. But then this morning he agreed that no matter who it is, allegations shouldn't make someone guilty. So even though I'm not a Hillary supporter or like her at all, I used that against him.

In the past, my friend shared a CNN news article about something (forgot what it was as its been a while), so I looked through older stories related to that and it showed CNN talk about the same topic, but was completely against it during the Obama administration.

So in the end, I use his own favorite news sources against themselves as they often contradict each other. Even one article was released, but a week before that it was a completely different stance on the same topic and it was by same author of the article as well.

As for my friend, he is still pretty left (his entire family is), but now he pays attention and actually does a bit of research before sending me things. Maybe he doesn't want to be proven wrong and doesn't want to get into arguments, or maybe he wants to find out the truth. Not sure. But, at the very least its shown him that the media isn't always so truthful.",19,2018-10-05 20:31:12,The_Donald,Trolldefender99,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/9lpfl1/ive_been_slowly_red_pilling_my_best_friend_from/,/r/The_Donald/comments/9lpfl1/ive_been_slowly_red_pilling_my_best_friend_from/,9lpfl1,CB[deleted],CA[deleted],CS[deleted],2018-10-05 13:46:10

Reddit censoring T_D on front page,"I've been noticing T_D posts making it to the front page of r/all and wasn't really surprised considering the 2018 election, Kavanaugh vote, and seeing 20k+ winners online at all times. But I was a little suspicious seeing a Trump tweet at #11 on the front page today, so I decided to open the page in Incognito mode to double check, and sure enough the post wasn't there.

It seems like Reddit is showing T_D posts in the top of r/all for members only and censoring them out for everyone else. No surprise really, but this kind of thing is so slimy.. They love making money from us (we are #3 on reddit by activity) but can't stand our opinions and values (liberty, justice, prosperity, due process, etc.) so they do anything they can to silence us while still benefiting from the massive traffic we bring them.

Summary of Senate Judiciary Committee Investigation
(as of October 4, 2018)
 
 
Background
 
The Senate Judiciary Committee has engaged in a thorough and robust investigation of allegations raised against Judge Kavanaugh. Throughout the last month, Committee staff members have collected statements, letters, and calls from individuals around the country. The reports range from substantive allegations of sexual misconduct, to short messages to senators passing along internet rumors and theories.
 
Committee staff continue to work tirelessly to pursue any and all substantive leads. In the course of the continuing investigation, staff members have spoken with 35 individuals, a task that requires extensive work during nights and weekends. More than 20 Committee staffers have contributed to the investigative efforts. The Committee has not received any evidence that would corroborate the claims made by Dr. Ford, Ms. Ramirez, Ms. Swetnick, or anybody else.
 
Allegations and Subjects
 
Ford Allegations
 
In response to Dr. Ford‚Äôs allegations, Committee staff repeatedly requested an opportunity to interview Dr. Ford, but her lawyers repeatedly refused. Committee staff offered to fly to California or any other location to interview Dr. Ford. But as Dr. Ford explained at her hearing, she was not clear that this offer had been made.
 
The Committee thus reopened the hearing on Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs nomination.
¬∑         During the additional hearing day (Day 5), the Committee solicited more than 8 total hours of public testimony under oath from Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh.
¬∑         In connection with the hearing, the Committee collected 24 pages of evidence from Dr. Ford in two productions. The Committee also received Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs calendars.
 
The Committee also received a statement, submitted under penalty of felony, from Dr. Ford‚Äôs ex-boyfriend, who cast serious doubt on the credibility of some of Dr. Ford‚Äôs testimony before the Committee.
¬∑         Notably, he stated that he had not known her to have any fear of flying or related claustrophobia and that she had previously provided advice to someone on how to successfully take a polygraph, directly contradicting her hearing testimony.
¬∑         Despite repeated requests by the Chairman, Dr. Ford still has not supplied several key items, including the charts from her polygraph examination, any recording of her polygraph examination, and the therapy notes that she claimed corroborated her story. Dr. Ford has not provided these therapy notes to the Committee, even though she shared these same notes with the media.
 
In addition to conducting the hearing, the Committee obtained statements from the three individuals who Dr. Ford identified as being present at the 1982 gathering: PJ Smyth, Leland Ingham Keyser, and Mark Judge (who submitted two statements).
¬∑         Each person denied having any knowledge of the alleged gathering. Ms. Keyser stated that she does not even know Judge Kavanaugh and does not recall ever meeting him. And Mr. Smyth and Mr. Judge each said they had never witnessed Judge Kavanaugh engage in conduct of the kind described by Dr. Ford.
 
The Committee contacted a total of 15 former classmates of Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford. The Committee also received several statements, signed under penalty of felony, that support Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs explanation of terms in his high school yearbook.
 
Finally, prior to Day 5 of the hearing, the Committee staff conducted a transcribed telephone interview with Judge Kavanaugh regarding Dr. Ford‚Äôs allegations. The Minority staff refused to attend.
 
Ramirez Allegations
 
In response to the allegations from Ms. Ramirez, the Committee contacted Ms. Ramirez‚Äôs counsel 7 times seeking evidence to support the claims made in The New Yorker. Ms. Ramirez produced nothing in response. Ms. Ramirez‚Äôs counsel refused the Committee‚Äôs request for an interview. Committee staff nevertheless pursued the investigation. Staff interviewed 5 witnesses with relevant information. Committee staff also investigated the public statements of 3 other individuals and found they had no knowledge of the alleged event.
 
Prior to Day 5 of the hearing, Committee staff conducted a transcribed telephone interview with Judge Kavanaugh, subject to penalty of felony. He denied Ms. Ramirez‚Äôs allegations. Minority staff attended the interview under protest and refused to participate.
 
Swetnick Allegations
 
In response to allegations by Ms. Swetnick, the Committee requested evidence on 6 occasions from her. Ms. Swetnick refused the Committee‚Äôs request for an interview. Despite this obstruction, Committee staff attempted to pursue the investigation by interviewing 12 witnesses who claimed to have relevant information. Committee staff obtained two sworn statements from individuals with knowledge of Ms. Swetnick‚Äôs character and allegations.
 
Prior to Day 5 of the hearing, Committee staff also interviewed Judge Kavanaugh on these allegations on two separate transcribed telephone interviews, subject to penalty of felony‚Äîboth before (when Ms. Ramirez‚Äôs allegations were also discussed) and after Ms. Swetnick was identified by name. Judge Kavanaugh denied Ms. Swetnick‚Äôs allegations, asserting that he does not even know Ms. Swetnick. Minority staff attended the interview under protest and refused to participate.
 
Anonymous Allegation from Colorado
 
In response to an anonymous allegation claiming Judge Kavanaugh pushed his girlfriend against a wall in a violent and sexual manner in 1998, Committee staff obtained a sworn statement from the woman dating Judge Kavanaugh at the time. She unequivocally denied that this incident ever took place.
 
Committee staff also questioned Judge Kavanaugh on these allegations during a transcribed telephone interview, subject to penalty of felony. Like his then-girlfriend, he denied that the incident ever took place. Minority staff attended but refused to participate in the interview.
 
Allegations by Others
 
The author of one allegation recanted in a public Tweet. The Committee referred the individual to the FBI for possible violations of 18 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 1001 (materially false statements) and 1505 (obstruction of congressional-committee proceedings). Committee staff questioned Judge Kavanaugh about the allegation during a transcribed telephone interview, subject to penalty of felony. He unequivocally denied the allegation. Minority staff attended but refused to participate in the interview.
 
A second allegation was completely anonymous. Committee staff questioned Judge Kavanaugh about the allegation during a transcribed telephone interview, subject to penalty of felony. He unequivocally denied the allegation. Minority staff attended but refused to participate in the interview. A woman has subsequently begun contacting Senate offices, claiming to be the author of the anonymous letter. Even though there are doubts about the authenticity of her claim, Committee staff is investigating.
 
Conclusion
 
The Committee‚Äôs investigation, like the FBI supplemental background investigation, has found that there is no corroboration of the allegations made against Judge Kavanaugh.

Few have talked about this aspect - less people are being fired/dropping out of the workforce because of a stronger economy building businesses, and because of the low unemployment - employers have to fight harder to attract and keep their employees.

I think I saw that something like 3k people went off of social programs last month alone - has anyone done the math on that?

When you add up food stamps, section 8, employment insurance paid out and the overhead to run these agencies - how much on average do you guys think each single new job saves the taxpayer - and that's before you start collecting the new income taxes?

When you consider that some jobs will be to parents who have dependents who also no longer need those social welfare programs - what would the average be? $4,000 per month each? 

So in one month, our social services programs were saving a combined $4k x 3k = $12,000,000 *every month*?

* Women's studies

* Race studies

Ever notice none of these ""Studies"" degrees are Sciences? Why? **( **HINT:  You can earn a degree in Computer Science, not Computer Studies.)**

What would a degree in Gender Science look like?  It would take 5 minutes to earn because science says there are 2 genders and some people with a debilitating mental birth defect.

> 09/03/2018 notes (9th of March news notes)

A man in Seattle had his gun confiscated by police after breaking no laws. They took his guns without warrant and without pressing any charges with their new red flag law, no formal arrest either. This is taking place in other states also and allows them to take guns from people they deem as dangerous. Apparently he was staring at neighbors through a storefront window with a concealed carry, was not brandishing weapon and complaints were given saying that his concealed carry was making neighbors feel unsafe.

Next line.

Kim Jong Un hosted a dinner for senior South Korean delegates, the first time officials from Seoul have met the leader since he took office in 2011

Relations between the Koreans have warmed after the winter olympic games, goal to restart dialogue between the Koreans as well as the US

The South Korean delegation includes two ministerial envoys, Intelligence Chief Suh Hoon and National Security Advisor, Chung Eui-yung

The North Korean state radio earlier said they met at the airport by Ri Son Gwon the North Korea reunification chief who led talks before the olympics


##Ri Son Gwon - the North Korea reunification chief

EVERYBODY wants peace with a UNIFIED KOREA! The amount of money to be made there, CUCKS will be foaming at the mouth to set up a StarCUCKS on every street fucking corner! Believe me, folks!

I then saw posts from folks at that sub hammering the boss of reddit to ban ""T\_D"" for all of the myriad of lefty sins being committed there. So I searched for T\_D in reddit, and this sub popped up. I am now a subscriber to this sub, and am curious if this is the sub that the left wants to have shut down by the boss of reddit?

Loving This Community!,"I have been on this sub since before the 2016 election and I just wanted to voice my opinions.

When I go about browsing on the usual subreddits, in almost every news post there are mass amounts of liberal comments that are purely based on hate. Everyone criticizes Donald Trump in every way imaginable. Whether it is based on his policies, his words, his demeanor, or even his looks. 

When looking at Trump's Twitter comments, this hate is even more amplified with **YUUUUUGE** amounts of ""Fuck you"" and ""You're a rapist"". Celebrities, politicians, even whole companies and corporations are turning against Trump.

Even at my school. Teachers hate him and students hate him. There are only negative opinions of him while a few absolutely love him.

The very vocal Left is extremely disrespectful in every aspect. But the silent majority still prevails.

When I browse this subreddit, I **ALWAYS** leave with a smile. Seeing the support and acceptance spread around here is amazing. I was just realizing all this when looking at Lindsey Graham's (God bless that legend) selfie and the comments on it. We take negative situations and always manage to turn them positive. Rosie O'Donnell's comments about Graham being a ""closeted idiot"" is turned around here as him being uninfluenceable by the woman's BS. This daily gumption (I've been waiting to use that word for a long time) is what keeps me, and I'm sure almost all of you, coming back daily.

The Left portrays us as negative and hateful but I only see that attitude from them, not us.

I just wanted to say thanks to everyone for making the past 2 years great and I'm looking forward to an amazing future.

**Stay based pedes!**

Judge Kavanaugh !!!," Well only hours away now from having Judge Kavanaugh as our newest Supreme Court Justice!!! But what you may not know . As many Democrats stated that this was a job interview??? Yes they were correct. But this was a Black List that was placed on Kavanaugh and if there was no press on this he would have suffered the wrath fully on being permanently Black Listed . Very seldom have you herd of this tactic being pub. I know all to well for what Kavanaugh has been going through. Since first recognizing back in 2009 that I e was being attacked by this same tactic is not fun . They will not stop attacking Kavanaugh even after he takes his chair . My family and over 10 years of suffering from this same action is not anything I would wish on even those who still attack me today . Just look around any comments I make here on Reddit and you can see them . Baseless attacks over and over . But if it was not made public and 4 Senators stood up and called out the BS , they would have destroyed him , it‚Äôs not by chance that you have several Republicans that have spoken out against Kavanaugh, if it was not this close to the mid turn Kavanaugh would have been destroyed. It‚Äôs no fun being subject of the games and attacks. Take some time and look how they chase me all over just Reddit, this happens in the real world also .

They‚Äôre stating that Hillary and Trump were a lose lose situation for the American People and Kavanaugh is as well; a loss  if not appointed over hearsay and a loss if appointed at all because the Supreme Court will fall into imbalance.

"Had a blast last night at President Trump‚Äôs MAGA Rally in Rochester, MN!","I'm still so pumped from last night. My first time ever going to an actual political event. So awesome to see the leader of the free world walking out 100 feet away from me, let alone Trump! He spent a good 5 minutes just taking in the crowd going nuts for him before his speech.

My dad and I drove down to Rochester, arriving about 10am. There was already about 1000 people in line. By the time they let us in there were people snaked back and forth and around the block as far as I could see. My uncle got in line at 4 and said it was insane. Easily 10000 in front of him that didn't get in.

Still pumped from last night. My first time ever going to an actual political event. So awesome to see the leader of the free world walking out 100 feet away from me, let alone Trump! He spent a good 5 minutes just taking in the crowd going nuts for him before his speech.

My dad and I drove down to Rochester, arriving about 10am. There was already about 1000 people in line. By the time they let us in there were people snaked back and forth and around the block as far as I could see. My uncle got in line at 4 and said it was insane. Easily 10000 in front of him that didn't get in. Some crowd shots are in the album

"Double Agent, Jordan B. Peterson.","Although Dr Jordan B Peterson has openly been against the ‚Äúmodern left‚Äù, many works he‚Äôs done in the past indicate that politically speaking he is Socialist/Globalist. Today he stood in favor of what he claims to fight against. 

He originally became popular for rejecting gender pronouns in the University in which he taught. Today he is telling Conservatives that Kavanaugh should step down even if confirmed, to ‚Äúclear his name‚Äù and allow a less ‚Äúdivisive‚Äù candidate to step in his place.

In other words, he is saying this man should allow his opportunity to be a Supreme Court justice to be stripped away from him, due to false sexual assault allegations from the left.

According to many, Peterson is playing the interests of right wingers, in order to slowly pied-piper his fans away from the nationalist movement which got Trump elected.

TLDR; Jordan B. Peterson stands against the modern left, but he is definitely NOT righr wing. He is looking to slowly but surely alienate his fans from the right wing movement.

This is why I always say *I am a survivor* of a false accusations of sexual assault. I am trying to affect the same emotional outcome as when you hear someone say ‚ÄúI am a survivor of sexual assault.‚Äù It‚Äôs depressing to me that there are so many people who will legitimately support, empathize with, and stand with victims of sexual assault, harassment, and misconduct, but we suffer in silence waiting for this scarlet letter to be exposed to everyone we know. 

You can see it in how they dehumanize people for their gender or their skin color. They do this so that it‚Äôs harder for people to show us empathy. For better or worse, manipulating the language is how you force people to consider empathy, and we *never* do this. ",CA[deleted],3,2018-10-05 19:10:31

What if the Trump-Russia Collusion Hoax a Chinese Psy-Op?,"Think about it:

Diane Feinstein couldn't have been the only Senator working with the Chinese.

All of Crooked's emails were being cc:d to a foreign entity not Russia.

We just discovered China, who manufactures 90% of our computers and 60% of our cell phones, not to mention other computer products used in our military equipment, has been inserting micro-chips the size of pencil tips into our electronics.

Who, exactly, allowed China to have access to 90% of the world's computers and 60% of its cell phones?

Why does Tucker Carlson warn us about China, who he feels is our nation's greatest threat, almost every night?

Pakistan is a close ally of China. Who had access to the house congressional servers? A few Pakistani nationals, that's who.  They transferred over a terabyte of information to who-knows-where and then Imran Awan said that was his kid's homework.  Right, a grade schooler has a terabyte of homework.

When a copy of those servers were requested, Javier Bacerra turned over a fake copy.  He became attorney general of California, the nexus of our entertainment industry, its inhabitants so completely brainwashed (Cher, Barbara Streisand, etc.). Leaky Adam Schiff and Greasy Ted Lieu land.  Pelosi. Feinstein. 

Who has the power to take over Hollywood and brainwash the Hollywood elite, turning them into raving lunatics?  I watched the Manchurian Candidate, didn't you?

Why did every one call Obama the Manchurian Candidate?

Why was the US sending billions of dollars to China, because on paper it was still a ""developing economy?"" 

Who benefits if the U.S. and Russia go to war?  Why is CNN scaring us with Russian nuclear submarines amazingly at the same time as Kavanaugh will most assuredly be confirmed for the Supreme Court?

Why was Lindsey Graham questioning Kavanaugh about military tribunals, and crimes of treason? 

Was this amazingly insane demonstration of depravity by the left really about abortion or maintaining political power? Especially seeing as how the whole Ford psy-op is blowing up in their filthy faces?  

Last year, after an amazing martini made with absinthe, gin & vodka, flavored with bitters & citrus garnished with a rose bud shrub float, I asked my co-workers, what if this whole Russia thing is Chinese propaganda? And they laughed at me and told me not to have any more to drink.

Is there something going on here that we should know about? Or am I just high?

People are taking the Jordan Peterson ‚Äúbetrayal‚Äù a little too much to heart I think.,"I think people have misunderstood Dr. Peterson from the getgo.  I think this is being brought to light with his recent tweet.  He never once claimed to be a conservative.  In fact, he has claimed the opposite.  But he isn‚Äôt a leftest extremest.  He‚Äôs a level headed classical liberal; with probably more liberal than classical.  One with whom I both agree and disagree with on many things.  In the end, though, I think he‚Äôs a ‚Äúpeace above all‚Äù type of person, and, if I were to guess,  that would be the reason I think he posted the tweet.  Jordan Peterson may in fact be presuming BK‚Äôs guilt without evidence, but that would be excessively out of character for him.  I may be wrong here, but it seems to me that his tweet had more to do with deescalation than it did with ‚Äúselling us out‚Äù.  

The people claiming he ‚Äúsold us out‚Äù are sensationalizing, because he was never on our team to begin with.  He was never on a team at all as far as I could tell.  He has a liberal point of view on many things and conservative one on many other things.  Just like most people in America who don‚Äôt get bent out of shape over politics.  But just because he‚Äôs a liberal, doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs an extremist and is out to burn down MAGA.  I think this is the one case where people can back up and say ‚Äúok, that guy might not agree with me, but he‚Äôs not my enemy; unlike the weirdos trying to throw blood on people...‚Äù  Again, I may be wrong, but he has a pretty solid track record of level headedness, and I think the least we could do is hear him out before deciding that he‚Äôs just as bad as Nancy Pelosi...

What‚Äôs more, he‚Äôs Canadian.  Who cares?  He can‚Äôt even vote here.

Trump taught me how to handle my abusive ex-husband.,"I was in a terrible and abusive marriage and after I divorced he continued to constantly attack me through custody battles and harassment. He basically treated me like the media treats Trump. Constant blame and accusations. I can never do anything right. I am blamed for absolutely everything  under the sun even though he is abusing me and my child. He is a victim and I am a monster. 

For years I tried to reason with him, defend myself with the truth and do what is decent and right. It never ever worked. 

During the election campaign I kept watching the Trump rallies and the speeches he gave. I saw how he handled the media accusations and the attacks of his adversaries. I saw how they accused him of everything they did. He didn‚Äôt defend himself. He told the TRUTH and never tried to appease them. 

I couldn‚Äôt get enough of seeing him stand up to the intimidation tactics and not giving in. In fact whenever he was attacked he attacked back HARD. ‚ÄúNot only are we gonna build the wall, but now it‚Äôs gonna be ten feet taller! And Mexico is going to pay for it!!‚Äù

It was unprecedented! It started to change me! I started using the same tactics! You want to accuse me and lie about me and attack my character??!  I don‚Äôt care. I will attack and punish you. 

You want to intimidate me? I will come at you without fear but with an attack you won‚Äôt recover from. I finally stood up to the bully and GUESS WHAT!!! 

It worked!!! He turned out to be a big fat ‚Äúgrab em by the p^$$¬•!!‚Äù

After 14 years of HELL my ex has basically disappeared from our lives! He is no longer around and I have barely heard from in in almost a year!!

"Where's Trump on vaccines today? Has there been any new statements since 2015 (being pro vaccines, but worried about amount of vaccines over a short period of time)?","Hi hi!

I'm working on a masters thesis about anti-vaccination. I'm not from the U.S, so I'm not very well informed on the particulars of current political events. I'm hoping you guys might be able to help me.

Trump is cited in many cases as claiming that vaccines cause autism (primarily due to tweets in 2012 and 2014). But the last I've heard from him specifically was in 2015 when he said that he's all for vaccines, but the amount of vaccines over a short period of time is something that should be looked into. 

He has however held a donor meeting with the famous MMR = autism Andrew Wakefield 2016 and a few others, reportedly of the same ilk, and there was talk about appointing Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to head a committee on vaccine safety (who's known for his views about vaccines causing autism) which seems to have ebbed out sometime during 2017. (Honestly, I don't even know if that committee ever came into existence).

&#x200B;

As I'm sure you can understand, googling anything about Trump and vaccines just turns up an endless list of results about how Trump is an anti-vaxxer. Though my impression, due to no new headlines (that I can find, at least) about him saying or doing anything in that direction, I suspect he's either not prioritizing it or that he might've changed his view.

&#x200B;

Any and all help to resolve this matter or further suggestions as to how I can figure out what the current situation is, is greatly appreciated!",8,2018-10-06 03:52:17,The_Donald,Pleonastic,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/9lspla/wheres_trump_on_vaccines_today_has_there_been_any/,/r/The_Donald/comments/9lspla/wheres_trump_on_vaccines_today_has_there_been_any/,9lspla,"The unnecessary stuff added to vaccines is what causes autism IMO.

Thermisol (""organic"" mercury) is the big culprit.  I have heard of other crap in vaccines, but have not seen inserts which include those other substances.

Vaccines would be fine if they were just the deadened/damaged virus and purified water.

In the state of the union, this year, GEOTUS said he was going after big pharma, and they seem to not be cooperating with him on much of anything.  I am sure that whole ""right to try"" thing pissed them off.

My guess is things are going on behind the scenes that cannot be talked out by GEOTUS and as far as what we see: I think after Sessions' testimony, declassification of the FISA warrant, and some key arrests are made, big pharma will start cooperating.",CA[deleted],2,2018-10-05 20:09:49
So fighting sexual violence is worthy of the Nobel Peace Prize but MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH with North Korea and South Korea for peace isnt?,"https://www.npr.org/2018/10/05/654675123/denis-mukwege-and-nadia-murad-win-nobel-peace-prize-for-fighting-sexual-violence

So a guy who no one has heard about starts a few hospitals in one of those shit hole countries is worthy of the Nobel Peace Prize? I mean come on. Congo is the fucking Rape Capital.

"Too all MAGA Fathers, and Sons.","Americans haven never been so awake, the red pill is real, and we can see the propaganda bullshit, the communist left, and the war on American men. 

&#x200B;

 DonJR tweeted we are at war, and we need to turn out and vote, this is completely true. . We must vote for our daughters, wives, sons, brothers, mothers, and family. This turn out needs to be the biggest fuck you to the socialist communist left.  You need to re-join the meme war, spread everywhere you can, spread on facebook, twitter, reddit, co-workers, bumper stickers, everything. 

Make sure you're donating, make sure you're calling, putting up signs in your community. 

&#x200B;

We are at a [infowar.com](https://infowar.com) with it becoming more and more physical daily. You must be prepared. 

A time will come when you need to protect your family, you need to be armed, but more importantly, physically fit. 

&#x200B;

Growing up in such peaceful times, peace like the world has never seen before, has made many men soft, lazy, and massive beer drinkers. If you haven't already, it's time to check your physical health, get to the gym, lean out, and re-join the MMA. 

&#x200B;

Soyboys are loading up on soy protein, round house kicking our women in the face. We have our proud boys, but we need more. 

&#x200B;

Do not shield your children from politics, do not let the school system educate them on politics. Train them from a young age about being RIGHT, and allow ridicule of the left. Have them sit and watch Trump Rallies, have them watch the left beating people, let them know who the enemy is, and why they are the enemy. 

&#x200B;

The physical war is coming, prepare yourself, prepare defense, and understand who is and isn't safe in your local community. 

&#x200B;

Soros has created so many organizations, paid protesters, and control of social media, that they are trying to brainwash and ware us down (Womans March, BLM, etc). 

We need to be our own activist. If you have never called a senator before, or for a boycott of something, you need to start. 

&#x200B;

The left have organizations dedicated to de-platform in order to implement thought control through media repetition. 

Looking at the mindless zombies today chanting was absolutely scary, they have demonic black glazed eyes, with no thought behind it. These are the kids that parents didn't teach the true American path. 

&#x200B;

Fight for our boys, fathers, and families, we won the battle today, but the war is far from over.

"This is my #MAGA moment. Poignant, but glad to get this off my chest.","First of all, - just for some background: My Mum died right when I was born, (she was actually really, really hot- but this isn't about her. I guess that's fucked up to say, but whatever.) I actually grew up with my dad's family, because my dad has all sorts of emotional issues and he bailed before I was born. So you can see, my childhood was really kind of messed up.

Anyways, growing up I feel like there was always a lot of distance between me and my sister. When I was about 17 or 18 I first noticed that my sister was a hottie.

I don't want to go into too many details about it, but basically what happened is that I accidentally found a video that she made of herself. I knew she didn't make it for me- but I thought she was so fucking beautiful that I watched it twice. I probably would have watched it a hell of a lot more, except that like right around the time I found the video, all this crazy shit went down and I had to leave home. (My dad's family who I was staying with got in bad trouble with the law. I never talk about it).

Sooo... I was totally lusting after my sister at that point. She was also having bad trouble with the law. She was actually in custody when I left home.

My friend and I went to go pick her up. When I saw her that day, after seeing the video, I have to be honest, I just wanted to fuck her brains out. Looking back on it now, it's pretty messed up- but I think she had feelings for me too. She actually kissed me right after we came to get her... and it wasn't a sisterly kiss, you know? I mean, it wasn't like ridiculously sexual or anything, but it definitely wasn't sisterly.

After we left, we all went to crash with my Sister's friends. On the trip there, my friend sort of implied that he wanted to get with my Sister, and I got a little jealous. He's a good looking guy- and even though she was my sister- I just felt like he was competition. Not much else happened between us for a while except some maybe-sexy hugging. Pretty much everyone in my life at that point was wanted by the government, so we all moved around a lot. I'm not saying that I'm proud of it or anything, but it was kind of an awesome time.

My friend and my sister never hooked up I don't think- but I thought there was some serious sexual tension going on between them. It was around that time that I got really badly hurt in an accident. It was fucked up. I almost died. But when I was in recovery my sister came to see me, and out of the clear blue sky she started gives me this awesome, slow, passionate kiss on the lips.

Sadly (although, I guess for the best) nothing ever came of it. We spent some time apart... and I started to get really religious, so I tried not to think of her that way. It was actually going well for a long time- like I was totally over her.

But I have to say, like a year or so after all that stuff went down, we were out sailing (not like a date or anything romantic like that), and she was wearing like the hottest bikini I've ever fucking seen and it brought back all the old feelings. Sigh.

A little while later she actually wound up with my friend from before (the sexual tension guy). I can't say I was surprised. But even after she was shacking up with my friend, there was one time we were at a party... my friend was inside, and my sister and I were outside alone.

It was a really intimate moment. I think something might have happened, except that I killed the mood when I told her that Darth Vader was our father and that I had to go face him.

Long story  short: me and my father fought. It was arena/cage match style, 1 vs 2, me against him and ""The Emperor"". Dad finally broke down and turned against his team mate and we won. It was a true #MAGA moment.

Why I think Flake will vote YES.,"Consider a US Senator who is teetering on the fence regarding the Kavanaugh confirmation, a certain Jeff Flake.  Jeff Flake was among those Republicans who were targeted for assassination by leftist extremist James Hodgkinson at the Congressional baseball practice.

Is it outside the realm of possibility that being shot at by a deranged leftist at that softball game is at the very least weighing on his subconscious, if not entering his thoughts directly.

Logic Vs Feelings,"(Sent this to my Facebook friends and removed links) 

Last thoughts on Kavanaugh hearing.

Presumption of guilt.  Hang in there amigos while I build my case from assumptions and fact.

I would assume we can all can decry abnormally high conviction rates for African Americans. 

(7 to 1) Vox article 

This sad fact is produced through the presumption of innocence through a jury of our peers.  Oh did I miss speak? 97 percent of federal cases and 94 percent of state cases end in plea bargains without a jury.  

NYT article 

I find it saddening - That I don‚Äôt find these statistics abnormal.  They ring true after close observation of traditional sources of journalism and opinions espoused on social media.  

Believe victims.  I do when a proper case is brought for judgement before a judge and jury.  Even when juries can be spectacularly wrong.  But it‚Äôs the best we got.

For anyone to truly believe that Judge Kavanaugh is a rapists without any collaborating evidence is participating in a system where by innocents are wrongly convicted in the court of public opinion - not by their peers.

If justice was sought - Dr. Ford should have brought this case through proper channels in a timely manner; not through a tightly divided senate with preexisting biases. 

Though you may be in disbelief - asking Republicans to take a plea bargain by removing Judge Kavanaugh is of this same logic.  Without a proper trial how can one determine guilt with the passion of conviction?

Presumption of innocence? Presumption of innocence? No you say! For my feelings are just and I represent the oppressed! For accuser tells the truth! Say this to the poor man who sits in the cell built upon this line of reason.  Tell this to the family of Brett Kavanaugh who the FBI recently vindicated.  

Do not fret.  I‚Äôm assured you‚Äôll dismiss blind Lady Justice and this apolitical organization.  All to bolster your own political bias via antidotal evidence and conjecture - watching vindictively as another pillar of our republic falls victim, crumbling to your own court of public opinion.

I love you guys.,"Back in 2016, when I was Pro-Hillary and Anti-Trump, I believed the media when it came to to supporters of Donald Trump being racist, sexist, homophobic, etc. When I made the switch from Democrat to Republican, I learned that supporters of Donald Trump are some of those most tolerant people I have ever met. You all value the freedom of speech, religion, individual liberty, etc. I feel at home and I seriously love the fact that we beat the establishment against all odds. POTUS's win caused me to start studying and appreciating the Constitution for all of it's glory and worth. I honestly cannot wait to raise my right hand and swear the sacred Oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States of America when I swear-in with the Army. After that, I plan on studying political science and Constitutional Law. I cannot wait to run for office someday and pledge to unite this country like never before. I love you guys. I cannot wait to vote Republican on November 6th, 2018 and continue to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. God bless the Constitution of the United States of America, the United States of America, Americans, and all of you. ‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá∏",14,2018-10-06 05:05:19,The_Donald,taketherdpill,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/9lt4u5/i_love_you_guys/,/r/The_Donald/comments/9lt4u5/i_love_you_guys/,9lt4u5,"<3 We are a family, and we will Keep America Great together!",CA[deleted],6,2018-10-05 21:09:57

Let's hear it for the real survivors," 

https://i.redd.it/7y5t5eg0lhq11.png

**Let's hear it for the real survivors** 

*  Congressman **Steve Scalise** survived attempted murder by Bernie Bro James Hodgkinson, on June 14, 2017.
* Senator **Rand Paul** survived assault and battery by deranged leftist neighbor, November 3, 2017.
* Countless **Trump supporters** have survived brutal attacks by rabid leftists like the Bike Like Professor, Eric Clanton, April 15, 2017
* Judge **Brett Kavanaugh** survived attempted character assassination by the entire Democrat Party and Media Complex, September-October 2018.

These are real survivors. They didn't just lay out an accusation through their lawyers. The Left weaponizes the word ""SURVIVOR"" and gives this title to ""ACCUSERS"" in an effort to skip past proving up their claims. We must reclaim the word survivor for true survivors.

"Except for Tucker, stop watching cable news. I will explain. My Top Four conservative radio/podcast shows you should listen to every day.","Gonna rank my commentary sources in a way I feel a conservative should. 

**1.  The Rush Limbaugh Show.** For new pedes, Rush has been knocking it dead for decades. He predicts things that end up happening years later, like the pussification of males and the NFL. Rush is the GOLD STANDARD of conservative radio. You can hear him for free on AM radio from 12pm-3pm EST, or subscribe to Rush 24/7 like I do for $50 a year. (Mods, I‚Äôm getting nothing from Rush for saying this, trust me). 

**2.  The Mark Levin Show.**. Heard at different times during the day depending on your market, but Mark puts his show out for free on PodCast. Mark was a senior advisor to the Ronald Reagan judiciary and a BRILLIANT Constitutionalist. He backed Ted Cruz in the primary but is now fully on the Trump Train. His ability to dismantle leftist bullshit is impeccable. 

**3.  The Sean Hannity Show**. If you wanna know what Sean is gonna talk about BEFORE his 9pm EST Show on Fox News, listen to his radio show in the afternoon.  He has a lot more intellectual freedom, control, and liberty on his radio show than he does on TV. 

**4.  Louder With Crowder.**. Of course. Steven Crowder‚Äôs show is catching fire simply for his ability NOT to insult liberals, but to get liberals to insult themselves. It‚Äôs brilliant and entertaining to watch, and he can always be counted on for the massive bantz. 

I‚Äôll repost this intermittently over the next month to frustrate the leftist faggots who lurk and downvote because their girlfriends are out fucking the QB of the football team. 

If I‚Äôm forgetting any, tell me in the comments.

I warned you about Jordan Peterson. A lot of people were unhappy when I first came out and pointed out that Jordan Peterson is not a good guy, that Jordan Peterson is not on our side, that Jordan Peterson is not an enemy of the SJWs, and that he is not someone who's good for the Right. Now, the thing is, either you stand for what is right or what you don't, and when Jordan Peterson came out today against Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation and explicitly came out and said that if Kavanaugh is confirmed  -which he will be, by the way, in case you haven't heard,  two of the four maybe votes in the Senate have come out openly and confirmed that they are going to support Kavanaugh's confirmation and more significantly one of them is actually the West Virginia Democrat - so you know,  for years Jordan Peterson has said he's terrified of making the mistake that is going to ruin his career.  
  
> Now I don't know if this is actually sufficient to sink his career or not, but it should be,  because this makes very clear that Jordan Peterson is in league with the SJWs. Jordan Peterson is, in American terms, a Democrat and there's absolutely no question that the intellectual dark web, the Ben Shapiros the Eric Weinsteins, the recycled New Atheist known as Sam Harris, and Jordan Peterson himself, are all on the side of the Left. This is not a surprise, I mean,  I've been telling you guys this for ages. I knew that he was not a good guy, that he was not on our side, that he was part of the problem rather than part of the solution from the time I read his book. There are so many people who say such incredibly dumb things about Peterson because they happen to like one thing that he said, they happen to like two things that he said. Here's the thing you can always find something that somebody says that you agree with. That doesn't mean that their objectives are aligned with yours

**The final Senate vote on Judge Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court is expected to take place later on today (between 3-5 PM ET)**. - Could potentially be a lot sooner, around 3:30 PM (see updates below for more details!!)

He wrote it as a prediction of natural course of economic evolution. He didn't hate capitalism the way his modern and previous followers do and did, he saw it as a necessary and hugely beneficial way for a society to reach a level of wealth that they can become a communist utopia through the transitional state of socialism. A lot of his critiques of capitalism are valid. The concentration of wealth and power eventually stifling innovation by crushing competition is something we see today but even still we are not at a point in history where full socialism will make us thrive. It's certainly not until technology makes labor and resources virtually infinite that socialism would ever work. Capitalism is the best shot we have to make it there.

> ‚ÄúPresident George W.

Democratic senators accused him of being too partisan, with Senator Dick Durbin calling him the ""Forrest Gump of Republican politics"".[60] In 2003, the American Bar Association had rated Kavanaugh as ""well qualified"" (its highest category), but, after doing dozens more interviews in 2006, downgraded him as only ""qualified"".[61]‚Äù

Daily Bible Scripture: Daniel 6:19-23,"[Daniel 6:19-23 ESV] Then, at break of day, the king arose and went in haste to the den of lions. As he came near to the den where Daniel was, he cried out in a tone of anguish. The king declared to Daniel, ‚ÄúO Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to deliver you from the lions?‚Äù 

Then Daniel said to the king, ‚ÄúO king, live forever! My God sent his angel and shut the lions‚Äô mouths, and they have not harmed me, because I was found blameless before him; and also before you, O king, I have done no harm.‚Äù Then the king was exceedingly glad, and commanded that Daniel be taken up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no kind of harm was found on him, because he had trusted in his God.

Start from a position that every American is capable of making good choices for themselves every day, and that good choices lead to good outcomes over time. People can choose to be a victim, or people can choose to thrive. The United States has always been the land of opportunity - all it requires is a little effort and self motivation.

I warned you about Jordan Peterson. A lot of people were unhappy when I first came out and pointed out that Jordan Peterson is not a good guy, that Jordan Peterson is not on our side, that Jordan Peterson is not an enemy of the SJWs, and that he is not someone who's good for the Right. Now, the thing is, either you stand for what is right or what you don't, and when Jordan Peterson came out today against Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation and explicitly came out and said that if Kavanaugh is confirmed  -which he will be, by the way, in case you haven't heard,  two of the four maybe votes in the Senate have come out openly and confirmed that they are going to support Kavanaugh's confirmation and more significantly one of them is actually the West Virginia Democrat - so you know,  for years Jordan Peterson has said he's terrified of making the mistake that is going to ruin his career.  
  
> Now I don't know if this is actually sufficient to sink his career or not, but it should be,  because this makes very clear that Jordan Peterson is in league with the SJWs. Jordan Peterson is, in American terms, a Democrat and there's absolutely no question that the intellectual dark web, the Ben Shapiros the Eric Weinsteins, the recycled New Atheist known as Sam Harris, and Jordan Peterson himself, are all on the side of the Left. This is not a surprise, I mean,  I've been telling you guys this for ages. I knew that he was not a good guy, that he was not on our side, that he was part of the problem rather than part of the solution from the time I read his book. There are so many people who say such incredibly dumb things about Peterson because they happen to like one thing that he said, they happen to like two things that he said. Here's the thing you can always find something that somebody says that you agree with. That doesn't mean that their objectives are aligned with yours

A Public Thank You,"As is sit in my backyard, by my pool, with my new puppy on my lap, I find myself grateful. Not just for these things but, for the first time in a very, very long time, for the actions of the leaders of the Republican Party in the Senate. 

Mr. Graham and Mr. McConnell - *this is what winning feels like.*   It's empowering, exhilarating - almost intoxicating, isn't it?  Couple winning with taking a principled stand as you did and I would dare say that this moment in time will define your political careers.

"Roe v. Wade will stay, and that will mean more GOP wins.","Of course, abortion is evil, violent, and murder, and it's cool to imagine a society where thots get killed instead of innocent fetuses, but let's think about this. 

We are one month away from midterms. Two years away from the Presidential election. 

Why would Justice Kavanaugh and or the GOP push for overturning Roe v. Wade, which unfortunately the majority of the populace supports? 

In fact, Trump installing a Justice like Kavanaugh who seemingly respects the decision of Roe is a great political move. The left has no legitimacy to the claim that Kavanaugh wants to take women's ""right"" away to choose. 

If the SCOTUS and GOP decide to push for the overturning of Kavanaugh, we'll likely have an actual civil war, or at least mass unrest. The GOP would be destroyed in polling, and hundreds to thousands would be dead or arrested, with your major cities burned down and raided. 

Roe v. Wade is not going away. I'm almost willing to say it will **never** go away, unless if we ever get something like a President Pence or President Santorum; which is highly unlikely due to the fact that many members of the New Right are LGBT, minority, or support the legalization of drugs and social libertarianism aspects like non-monogamy and America's shift away from religion. 

If anything, I recommend you learn about and promote FADA, the [First Amendment Defense Act] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_Defense_Act), a long overdue piece of legislation to legalize religious-based discrimination. 

Hopefully, RBG kicks the can soon and we get Judge Cruz, Christie, or Barrett.

Gallery screamers MUST be invited by senators/reps - Hold them accountable!,"**If you have any way of learning who the gallery screamers each got invites from, please expose the truth!**

Getting an invite is not as simple as ""anyone from the public can join the gallery"" like some news outlets say.

**People in the gallery must request/get invite SIGNED from their senator/rep**, as shown here: https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/art/common/image_gallerypass/16_00136_000.htm

I got a scheduled Congress tour and still couldn't get into the gallery without one of these unqiue passes.

The only possible exception to this process would be international visitors - I'm not sure what the protocol is with them.

Kavanaugh is in. Now the work begins.,"Now that conservatives finally have unquestioned control, it's finally, finally time to get to work erasing all of the unconstitutional actions of the last 50 years of the SCOTUS.

Obergefell v. Hodges? GONE.

Grutter v. Bollinger? GONE.

Shelby County v. Holder? GONE.

US v. Nixon? GONE.

And most importantly, vitally, and expressly, Roe v. Wade? GONE. The rights of the unborn will finally be re-established, and I hope and pray that anyone who has ever performed or received an abortion will face the full brunt of the law.

They censor right wing voices because they know they are wrong and will lose in open debate.,"If their points of view had merit they would be able to debate with the right wing. Instead they have to censor ""populist"" voices. Why is that?

And now they've resorted to silencing their ideological opponents. They can't win the debate face to face.
