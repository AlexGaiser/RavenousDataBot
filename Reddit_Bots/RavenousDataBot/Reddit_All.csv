We're excited about some of the developments we've been working on and so we've decided to help clear things up by hosting an AMA. Led by andrologists Drs. Christina Wang and Ronald Swerdloff  at Harbor UCLA/LABioMed and Drs. Stephanie Page and Brad Anawalt at the University of Washington, the male contraceptive researchers at LABioMed are looking forward to your questions as they pertain to the science of male contraception and its impact on society.  Ask us anything!

A simulation for how octanethiol molecules bond to a film of gold and then self-assemble into a well ordered monolayer (SAM),,2998,6/16/2018 22:24,chemicalreactiongifs,crnaruka,https://i.imgur.com/Dj24i1y.gifv,/r/chemicalreactiongifs/comments/8rme6k/a_simulation_for_how_octanethiol_molecules_bond/,8rme6k,"**Explanation:**
---


This simulation gives a quick demonstration of the process involved in creating [a self-assembled monolayer on metals.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-assembled_monolayer) These are layers one molecule thick that coat the surface of a film. One neat aspect is that even such an incredibly thin layer can drastically change the properties of the surface. For example, pure silver is rather hydrophilic. In other words, water interacts quite strongly with it and can easily wet it. However once you add a single layer of octanethiol molecules, the situation changes drastically. The surface modified film now becomes strongly hydrophobic, so now water rather than wetting the film would tend to bead up and/or slip off entirely .

The reason is that octanethiol is composed of two main parts, an S-H head group that can anchor to the gold and a fatty hydrocarbon tail, a bit as shown in [this cartoon](https://i.imgur.com/qEaKRSz.png). This clip (simulated via [molecular dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics)) shows a nice summary of what happens once the thiol (SH) head group binds to anchor to the metal. The organic tails of adjacent molecules jostle around until they arrange into a tight arrangement where they can maximize their attraction (Van der Waals forces). The fatty organic film that envelops the gold may be thin, but it's enough to now effectively repel water. [For example here is the effect in action (on gold rather than silver).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvgEd71nHUg)

TIFU by ignoring doctor's orders and nearly killing myself.,"This didn't happen today, but yesterday, so the pain is still very real.

I have COPD, a very serious lung disease that eventually requires a lung transplant to fix it. I had spent the week living in a hotel room near my hospital getting evaluated, which includes a battery of tests. I was poked and prodded and jabbed and lost more blood than CM Punk in the UFC.

Two days ago (Thursday) I had a test so serious it requires a surgical team. A catheter was inserted into my wrist, up the main artery in my arm, and used to inject dye into my heart to measure it's behavior. I was *seriously* doped up for this test, so I wouldn't accidentally move and rip out the catheter and send blood hurtling towards the ceiling in a grotesque *True Blood* fountain.

After the test, I was very specifically warned not to exert myself for 48 hours, not to use my arm for anything strenuous, and to be under **constant supervision** by another person. So, of course, the next morning I got myself dropped off for another round of tests and told my caregiver to come back for me in 8 hours.

The test involved eating a very small meal (the only thing I was allowed to eat since the previous night), and having my stomach PET-scanned after 1, 2 and 4 hours. After the 2 hour check, I was incredibly bored, so I went outside and started walking around. (Full disclosure: I was hunting Pokemon. Hospitals, especially famous Children's Hospitals, are *havens* of Pokemon and Pokestops.)

After a while I sat down on a bench, in the sun, and fell asleep. Normally when I sleep I require oxygen to keep my blood O2 levels up, but this time I just fell out unexpectedly. So, I woke up already low on oxygen, and began feeling nauseous. At this point all I cared about was finishing this stupid test, and I was pretty sure puking up my breakfast would ruin it. So, I decided the right thing to do was move out of the sunlight into the shade, and start making my way back inside.

So, I stood up, and instead of heading about 6 inches to my right to the shady side of the bench, I began moving uphill towards the next bench, about 50 feet from where I was. I immediately felt light-headed, woozy, and dizzy. So, of course my immediate reaction was to ~~sit back down~~ make a run for it and hope I got to the bench before I passed out.

Spoiler: I did not.

Within about 5 steps, I suddenly felt my legs refuse to move where I told them, got them twisted around each other, and fell face first onto the ground. Thankfully, by sheer luck, I fell into the grass, and didn't hit any of the trees, rocks, or metal furniture in the immediate area. After laying there for about 2 minutes, I finally sat up and assumed the ""Triangle of Respiratory Distress"" pose, which looks roughly similar to a panicked person having a mental breakdown. A staff member came over and eventually a doctor and nurse got me wheelchaired up and back into the place.

Unfortunately, on impact I used my bandaged, off-limits arm to catch myself, which merely served to swing me sideways so my rib cage landed directly on my portal oxygen tank. Once I got back into the building, I noticed that I was having (more than usual) serious trouble breathing, and there was a nice bruise spreading quickly up my arm.

I guess if there's any place you need to fall down into a life-threatening condition, outside a hospital medical plaza isn't a bad choice. but if I had landed a few feet to the left, or fallen the other direction, or the staff member hadn't chosen that time to do some gardening, most likely I would have bled out while suffocating to death in my confusion. My chest still hurts, and I have to be on oxygen full time until the soreness dissipates and I can breathe again.

All because big bad me ""didn't really need"" constant supervision after major surgery.

"Fine, I’ll throw away all the pillows.","Format, on phone, all that good stuff. 

Setting: this happened about eight years ago when I worked for one of the biggest hotels in the U.S. I’m talking about 3200 rooms and that place is the size of a small city. My position was “supervisor of special operations” which means I was the guy they came to when they needed to, say, change 1000 bed frames for more modern ones, or change 5000 light bulbs for ones more energy efficient because we are going green, and stuff like that. 

Now, a hotel this big is divided into four buildings, each with their own managers, supervisors, housekeeping and the like, essentially it was run like four separate hotels. 
The problem was that each building’s managers had an exorbitant amount of power, and they ended up stepping on each other’s toes day in and day out. 

Because of my position I didn’t work directly for any of them but for the director of housekeeping, or DH(because what I did had mostly to do with rooms) so whenever one of them tried to get me to take special care of them and their buildings I could easily refuse but most of the time I did whatever they needed to get done if I had time and because they were mostly nice people and good managers. Enter douche canoe, or DC, DC was the worst manager I have ever encountered in my career, he would go into the check out rooms and steal tips from the housekeepers, take things left behind by guests instead of reporting them to lost and found, and talk to people like they owed him something, like his word was law. 

The story: One day we get a VIP guest, one of the owners of the company that owned the company that owned the hotel, so DH sends me to check the room he’s to check in to the next day, so I did, I checked all the furniture, bed frame, mattress, lamps, light bulbs, AC unit, everything I could think of and when I’m done I give the good to go. Fast forward a week, the day after VIP checked out, I get called into DH’s office and the conversation goes something like this: 

DH: so VIP had a complain about his room

Me: did I miss something?

DH: not really, it was housekeeping who did, he noticed that one of his pillows was stained (the pillows are in a protective cover inside a pillow case so he had to have taken it out of both to notice it was stained) and requested another one, which was also stained. 

Me: and you want me to do something about it

DH: I want you to check all the pillows during renovations, and take all the stained ones out of the rooms and send them to laundry and then place them back in the rooms.

Me: that’s gonna take a couple of days and some overtime but ok. 

The hotel was scheduled for renovations about three weeks from the date of the VIP pillow incident, where the hotel was supposed to shut down for two weeks and outside contractors would come in and do most of the work, during this time I was supposed to just stand by and help out the contractors with whatever they needed, but because of the pillow incident I now had something to do. 

So I had my instructions from DH and they date rolls by and me and my team get to work, about half way through the first building, I get a call on the radio from DC asking where I was (DH had had a family emergency and was out of town, leaving DC in charge of overseeing operations until he got back) I respond with my location and get back to work, about ten minutes later DC enters the room I’m currently working in and the conversation goes like this:

DC: you are going to throw away all the stained pillows 

Me: now why would I do that when I have clear instructions from DH?

DC: DH isn’t here and I’m telling you to throw away all the stained pillows. 

As soon as he finished the sentence he turned around and started walking away when I said “but”, and then he loses it and goes: YOU ARE NOTHING MORE THAN A GLORIFIED JANITOR, YOU WILL DO AS YOU’RE TOLD, THROW AWAY ALL THE STAINED PILLOWS AND LEAVE THE THINKING TO THE PEOPLE WITH COLLEGE DEGREES. To which I said nothing but “ok”. 

After he left I call my team on a different radio frequency and let them know the new plan, and get a lot of seriously? And what the fucks? So I tell them: that what the boss man wants and that’s exactly what the boss man will get. 

Anyways, we get back to work pulling stained pillows from rooms (remember, 3200 of them) 
So it takes us about three days, during this time we didn’t just dump the pillows as we went, we stashed them in a storage room by the dumpster (turns out most of the pillows were stained so we’re talking about 15000), so after we are done I emailed DC, and say: all the stained pillows have been pulled and are on stand by, again, should I just take them to laundry like DH originally told me to do, or should I proceed to dump them? To which he replied: yeah whatever just throw the away already like I told you to. So my team and I proceed to ask around the staff and gave a bunch of the away before filling four dumpsters with nothing but pillows. 

So days go by and I’m just helping out the contractors when I get an email from DC saying: why aren’t there pillows in the rooms yet? It was your responsibility. To which I replied: we don’t have enough pillows for all the rooms even with the stash (the stash was a storage room we kept full of new pillows, for whenever they broke, were bled on, or had too many people requesting extra pillows at the same time, but it was only like 500 give or take) we don’t even have enough for even one building. He replied: what do you mean we don’t have enough? How many pillows did you throw away? My response: you told me to throw away al the stained ones so I did, about 15000. To which he replied: 15000?!!!! How could you be such an imbecile? Now what are we supposed to do? We can’t delay the reopening. My response: I’m just I glorified janitor and can only follow orders, I’ll leave the thinking to the people with college degrees,

He the proceeds to call DH on his personal phone (who was out of town attending his father’s funeral) and belittle me, say how incompetent I am and how I threw away all the pillows I was supposed to have washed and put back in the rooms, so I get a text from DH that just said: DC told me what you did, we’ll talk when I get back in two days. 

During those two days I compiled a folder with the email thread with the pillow conversation and since I don’t have access to the security mainframe, went to my buddy who is the security manager and checked the cameras and I found the footage of him telling me that I’m a glorified janitor and to leave the thinking to the college graduates (there are no cameras in the rooms but the hallway camera caught the audio). The two days went by and as soon as I came in the next morning and pick up my radio I get a call from DH to meet him in his office, so I head there with my folder and my footage in hand. When I walked in he was sitting in his desk, with DC standing next to him, and the conversation went like this:

DH: take a seat. 

So I take a seat. 

DH: would you care to explain this situation you have put us in?

ME: no problem. 

I pulled out my folder, opened it, put it on his desk and push it towards him. 

He spends a couple of minutes reading it (including the transcription from the security footage), and when I can tell he’s done reading I said: they wouldn’t let me take a copy of the security footage as per policy but you can talk to “insert security manager’s name here” and he can show it to you. He then looks at DC with raised eyebrows, looks back at me and says: would you excuse us for a moment? I just nod, get up and walk out. About 30 minutes later comes out DC with the biggest puppy who peed on the carpet and got hit with a rolled up news paper face  I’ve ever seen, DH signals me to come in again and says: Mr. DC has decided to take some personal time indefinitely, carry on with your day. 

And that’s the story of how a manager tried to get me fired because of his stupidity and it didn’t work. 

TL;DR
Asshole manager tries to get me fired because of something he told me to do, gets fired instead.

I have never in my life seen a meme about how a man should deserve a Happy Mothers Day! I'm a single father with full custody. Personally, I don't really give a shit about fathers day.

Parents have a duty to raise their children well. 

People tell me all the time that its so good I'm being a dad. They tell me how brave I am for taking care of my own daughter. I'm really not. I'm doing what a parent is supposed to do. I'm not doing some altruistic thing that deserves praise and gifts. I'm not going above and beyond. Literally millions of years of evolution pushing me forward to be a loving parent.

"UPDATE: I just recieved a demand letter from Enterprise Rent-a-Car stating that if I do not return their rental car, I will be charged with Embezzlement and Grand Theft Auto. I never rented a car from them. (San Jose, California)","Thank you to everyone for the advice. I'm also a SHE by the way (many of you thought I was a dude lol), but on to the update:  
  
  
  
  

After my initial post, I saw that many of you advised for me to call the manager and demand information from her because Enterprise is the one at fault and I shouldn't have to go to the police for their mistake. So I did exactly this, and she told me that id I want her to give me more info, I would need to file a police report within 24 hours and email it to her as evidence that I am NOT the person who rented the car.  If not, she would report me for Embezzlement and Grand Theft to the Sacramento Police. Upon hearing this, I decided to file a report immediately online with the San Jose Police Department. I know many of you said I shouldn't because its not my fault but after she told me the consequences, I did not want to take any chances where I could end up with a warrant on my head.  I thought that if anything, filing this report would also prove my innocence if the police actually did come knocking on my door.  After filing it, I emailed her the copy and she responded the next day, saying that she recieved it and to give her a call.  When I spoke to her over the phone this time, she said that I was in the clear and finally gave me information about what had happened:  
  
  
  
  

On May 29, a woman claiming to be me had come in to rent out a black cadillac. She showed the representative ""her"" drivers license that had MY information on it, and paid for the car rental upfront with CASH. (I thought that you need a credit card to do this but apparently you can just use cash) The manager also says that she has video surveillance of the woman which she will turn into the Sacramento Police later that afternoon. The following morning, she emailed me the number of her report which she filed as FRAUD, and said that the police opened up an investigation which she will keep me updated on.  At this point, I was relieved to be in the clear yet also pissed that some woman is out there impersonating me. I then started contemplatig about taking a 3 hour drive to Sacramento see who the hell this woman is. However, turns out I didn't have to because 2 HOURS LATER...  
  
  
  
THE SAN JOSE POLICE DID SHOW UP KNOCKING ON MY FRONT DOOR. ( 2 Policemen and 2 CHP officers) Before opening it, the first thing I did was grab the copy of the police report I printed because I seriously thought that they were going to arrest me  (2 squad cars, 4 officers, and 1 me). When I open the door,  the first thing they ask me is if NAME OF WOMAN I DO NOT KNOW lives at my home? I tell them no, and that I have no idea who that is,  then they ask if I am ALYMG and I tell them that I am. They then begin to inform me about a car accident that happened in the nearby town of Fremont that morning. The accident was a hit and run, with the driver fleeing the scene but she dropped her drivers license which they found on the floor. They then show the license to me and it's an EXACT replica of MY DRIVERS LICENSE, and I ask them how this is possible if I have my license in my wallet? They then tell me to go grab it and after comparing the two side by side, one of them tells the others that the one they have is a fake. (The black strip on theirs is chipping but mine isn't... it's not supposed to chip) I then ask them if the driver  was the woman who stole the car from Enterprise, and they ask me to ellaborate which is when I hand them my report. I explain what happened which prompts them to give me more details about the accident, and they tell me that the woman was driving a stolen car and crashed into another vehicle, but she fled the scene in the black cadillac from Enterprise.  So basically, the rental car was used as the ""getaway car"" and was identified by the witnesses in the other vehicle. I told the officers that I have the plate number of the vehicle in the demand letter, and the that info down as well. I then asked them who is the NAME OF THE WOMAN I DO NOT KNOW and they told me that she is the who stole the car. However, I'm not sure how they know that (fingerprints maybe) but they did show me her mugshot, and we DO NOT look a-like at all. Idk how the hell she was able to rent the car in the first place but whoever rented it to her probably didn't even check for a comparison. But after this, the police then thanked me and told me that they'll call me when there's an update on the case.  
  
  
   
  
  
  

I do have her name now though, and After doing a google search I found her Facebook and other social media accounts. I'm very tempted to message her but I've decided to leave this to the police because I have no idea who this bitch is, and don't know if she's dangerous (she might be gang affiliated or something  and she DOES know where I live) However, I do hope that they catch this bitch and will update you all when that happens.

It's a pretty shit list. It's not just the list, but the reasoning behind some of the choices. Here's what they said about The Lord of the Rings.
>I liked The Hobbit. A lot. But while Tolkien's Lord of the Rings books are influential as exercises in world building, as novels they are barely readable. It never seemed to me that Tolkien cared about his story as much as he cared about rendering, in minute detail, the world he built. 

The one that really grinds my gears is Catch-22.

I love to capture the blooming tulips every year in my homecountry the Netherlands. Some people found it boring because 'it's always the same'. Not me. I try to capture them in different conditions and I had always want to capture them with some morning fog. If you look closely on this image you can see the small dew drops on the tulips. When the sun finally rose above the tree line, a golden glow covered the tulips giving a magic surreal atmosphere and moment. A morning I won't forget!

Gear used: Sony A7RIII, Sony 12-24 G, shot was focus stacked (taking multiple shots at different focal points) to get everything in focus from front to back.

Kids were 13 & 16, we'd gone to a relatives BBQ which was walking distance from home, hadn't planned on drinking but that's the way the night went. 

Eldest went home early so the boy & I wandered back after midnight. I remember play fighting with them in the living room, the next thing I remember is being in bed feeling sick. I was sick where I lay & tried to get up but couldn't & thought well I've messed the bed up already I may as well just carry on here. Then I got up to have a shower (opposite end of the house), kids woke up, I didn't have a towel so I ran back through to my room in the buff & collapsed on the floor. I woke up hours later, the kids had covered me up, stripped & cleaned my bed, washed all my sheets, dried them & remade my bed. 

They still bring it up ""remember when Mum was drunk & threw up over herself"" yeah, don't talk about all the times I wasn't drunk & was being a good Mum eh!

I thought there was something *wrong* with the baby as she comes over and stumbles through some questions; so I was the father and no one else was coming, etc. Then finally she awkwardly asks if either of us happened to be blonde growing up. 

I said yeah I was and both the baby's grandparents are blonde as they come and this wave of relief went over her and she brought me over to see this blonde as hell crowning baby head.

ELI5: The difference between a 500 calorie breakfast and a 500 calorie lunch vs. no breakfast and a 1000 calorie lunch,"Example numbers, of course. Mostly curious about meal-distribution and how it can affect the body.


Edit: Some people have asked what I mean by ""difference"", and I really don't know. I intentionally left it vague because I'm interested in any potential ways that meal-distribution affects the body. My motivation for asking isn't necessarily weight loss but overall health; I'm generally happy with what I eat, but my eating schedule is all over the place. Sometimes I'll have a large-ish breakfast, sometimes just a yogurt, sometimes nothing. Sometimes I'll make it to dinner only having had an apple in the morning.",2828,2018-06-18 15:28:22,explainlikeimfive,m2thek,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/8rzx78/eli5_the_difference_between_a_500_calorie/,/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/8rzx78/eli5_the_difference_between_a_500_calorie/,8rzx78,"You will find that many sources will have somewhat conflicting but also corroborative conclusions on meal frequency, similar to that of sleep cycle adaptation.  The ELI5 bottom line is that the human body is a master at adapting to and getting the most out of most situations.  That being said, there are a few fundamental differences in your scenario.

1. Mainly, forgoing a meal in order to extend a fast does allow for additional time for certain hormones to baseline.  For example, insulin is the most popular discussion point when it comes to extended fasting.  While it depends greatly on the individual, insulin levels tend to fall to their baseline anywhere between 8-12 hours in a fasted state.  Often diets recommend 16+ hours to be absolutely sure.  This period of time is not long enough for the body to enter a sustained fasted state.  A true sustained fast (3-4 days or more) is an entirely different matter, but this topic isn't about that anyway.

2. On the other hand, it has been posited that eating many small but frequent meals helps to keep the natural metabolic rate high.  This is also not necessarily the case.  It is true that fasting will reduce your metabolism, but this is a logical flaw in thinking because the dietary benefits of extended fasting outweigh the lower metabolic rate.  

3. A periodic (once in a while but routine) extended fast allows certain hormonal cycles to reset when you have a major change to your schedule/circadian rhythm.  This is why it is highly, highly recommended that you fast for ~16 hours when you are suffering from jet lag.  The reason behind this is simple, your daily rhythm is governed by a system of hormonal cycles which are affected by diet and sleep.  Ghrelin and leptin, the hormones in control of hunger/satiation naturally rise and fall with your sleep and dietary cycle respectively.  Giving your body an opportunity to line up its circadian rhythm with its other systems, such as hunger, greatly helps to speed up the adjustment time required for a new environment.  

4. There is also the simple, practical matter of how much food you can or cannot eat in a sitting/over a period of time.  Lean bulking with an IF diet is extremely difficult (IMO) to maintain due to the time restriction alone, whereas small meals may be just as if not more frustrating to cram into your schedule.  Whichever method will provide the most *consistency* in your ability to eat mostly healthy foods towards your specific dietary goal will be better in the long run.

5. There is always a subset of people who argue the ""ancestor diet"" in that our modern eating habits are all misaligned for which our bodies were evolutionary designed.  They state that it should be normal to fast for 2-4 days and eat large meals on a periodic basis, using the type of nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle that humans have spent millions of years perfecting.  While it is true that for the vast majority of human history the modern diet was not a thing, still IMO the body is more than capable of adjusting to a modern agrarian diet if we simply restrict our over-consumption of certain macronutrients as evidenced by the simple fact that *lifespan* has not decreased over the ages.

Also, I am sure you know this but the whole ""breakfast is the most important meal of the day"" was a straight up ad campaign that is not based on any sort of hard science.  ",CA[deleted],1,2018-06-18 11:53:24.780655

TIFU by stopping my double jointed daughter from beating on my son,"This was my one and only time I ever had to do this, or that there was ever a full blown fist fight in my house. Also, obligatory this isn’t recent. 

My oldest son, who was at the time 15, was getting his ass kicked by my oldest daughter who was at the time 17. She was absolutely beating the tar out of him. Knowing her and her level of self control, he probably was really asking for it. 

I worked security, and I’ve worked security most of my life. I’ve seen just about every type of fight you can imagine. Bar fight, gang fight, school fight...  

I assumed using some of those security skills would be put to good use. I put my daughter in a Full Nelson and rotate her away from the fight. What I didn’t do is talk, she doesn’t know if it’s me or another one of her brothers that has her in that full Nelson. 

She contorted her shoulder forward and elbow in a way where she escaped the Full Nelson and elbowed me in the nose and hit me in the solar plexus while she was at it. 

I fell back, and when she looked back she gave the “Oh shit” look. My son started cackling, and I was bleeding from the back of my nose into my throat. My nose wasn’t broken, but that in combination with the solar plexus hurt so bad, probably the top 10 pains I’ve ever felt, and occasionally still have nosebleeds since then 

Tl;dr: Don’t put your double jointed daughter in a full nelson, or you might have a bad day.

There was this tramp,"One cold winter's morning he was walking along a country road, when he heard a cry for help from a nearby lake.

He turned to see a little girl struggling in the broken ice in the middle of the lake.  She'd been skating and had fallen into the icy water.
Without a moment's hesitation the tramp ran onto the ice and slipped and slided over to the little girl.  He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and he carried her back to the road.  

He took off his coat and wrapped the little girl in it and began looking for a car to flag down. A few moments later a huge chauffeur-driven limo pulled up, and who stepped out but the little girl's father - the mayor of the nearby town and a multi-millionaire.

""How can I ever thank you sir?"" says the father after putting his daughterinto the warmth of the limo.  

""Just name your price - I'm a wealthy man.""

""Ahem, well ..."" stammered the tramp ""...eh I'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out""

""Certainly"" says the girl's father and he pulls out his wallet.

""Oh dear"" says the father, ""I don't carry much cash with me, I only have ten dollars - but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe""

""No! No!"" says the tramp, ""Why ten dollars is more money than I've seen in my whole life - that will be plenty"".

""Well, if you insist"" says the father - ""now what will you do with your money?""

""Oh that's easy"" says the tramp ""I've not had a rest in 20 years.  I think I'll buy myself a holiday""

""Well good luck"" says the father, and he gets into the car and signals his chauffeur to drive home.

""Ten Dollars"" thinks the tramp, ""I'm rich!  I'm rich!"", and off he goes to the town, to buy himself a holiday.

He finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk.  

""I'll have one holiday please!""

""Ahem, which holiday would sir like"" asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.

""Oh, any holiday I don't mind"" replied the tramp.

""Well how much money does sir have to spend on sir's holiday?""

""Oh lots - anything up to ten dollars""

""TEN DOLLARS!!  You'll *never* get a holiday for ten dollars"" says the girl incredulously.

""Oh dear"" said the tramp, ""and I was so looking forward to a holiday - I'll probably never get another chance - isn't there anything you can do?""

""Well I don't think so sir, but hold on and I'll check""

The girl goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find.  There - to her amazement - she finds an old file.

""Well you'll never believe it"" she says to the tramp, back in the shop.

""I've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten dollars""

""Yippee"", exclaims the tramp, ""I'll take it""

The tramp takes the tickets and, shouldering his dirty old pack, he heads out the door to hitch-hike to the port where the ship is waiting.

*************************

A few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen. Amazed at his luck and good fortune, he slings his pack over his shoulder, and marches up the gangplank.

""Get off my ship ye dirty bum!"" shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.

""But I've got my ticket!"", responds the tramp, ""Super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!""

Hardly believeing his eyes, the captain examines the ticket and admits that our man the tramp is correct.

""Ahem, well O.K."", says the captain, ""But you can't come on just now, I don't want my first-class passengers seeing you.  Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then.""

So the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.

""Psst"", says a voice, waking him with a start.  It was the captain.

""Hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin""

The tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship! The tramp had *never* in his wildest dreams imagined luxury like this. 

First they went doen through the first class level:

Oriental carpets - 6"" pile.

A genuine Rembrahndt on every wall.

Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair.

24 ct gold trim everywhere.

Then the second class:

As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3"" deep.

and so on...

3rd, 4th, 5th class,

down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with, a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.

""Sheer luxury!"" exclaimed the tramp, ""A room of my very own.""

""I'm glad you like it"" replies the captain, ""but there is one more thing...""

""Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep.  So that's what the alarm clock is for.  Enjoy your cruise.""

Well the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time.  Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...

Then one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool.  He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below. He climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived....

...and what a dive...!

Perfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple. Now unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.

""That was amazing!"" exclaimed the captain, ""Where did you learn to dive like that?""

""Eh, well I've never actually dived before"" replied the tramp.

""Well that's incredible!"" says the captain, ""I've never seen ....""

He broke off.

""Hey, I've an idea"", he started again.

""How would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers.  I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!""

""It's a deal!"" says our man.

For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it. Then one morning the captain came to talk.

""O.K. I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days.  We're going to erect a high diving board for you.""

""O.K."" agreed the tramp.

Two days passed, and the big day arrived.  The ship was humming with excitement.  Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck.

Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Then the tramp turned to regard the diving board. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.

""Well tramp"" said the captain, shaking his hand, ""Let's see what you can do.""

And with that the Captain handed him a walkie talkie.

And the tramp began to climb....

up and up ...

up and up ...

higher and higher ...

below him the ship grew smaller ...

up and up ...

on and on ...

past a solitary albatross ...

and still higher, till the ship was but a speck on the ocean below ...

still further, till the ocean grew dim, and the earth itself began to shrink...

and higher, ever higher ...

on and on ....

higher, and higher, and on and on towards the diving board,

He climbed on top and radioed the captain .... and then...

he jumped . 

slowly at first     

but speeding up     

faster, and faster

and by now the earth was growing large in the distance,

the oceans and land masses grew clear,

faster, and faster...

past the albatross,

faster

double-back somersault,

and he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,

hurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet,

Down on the ship the crew strained their necks,

""I CAN SEE HIM!"" yelled a passenger, ""LOOK!!""

The tramp streaked down towards the pool, did a last triple flip, and dove...

NOT A RIPPLE ON THE SURFACE!

DOWN THROUGH THE WATER!

SMASHED THROUGH THE POOL BOTTOM!

DOWN THROUGH THE FIRST DECK!

SMASHING THROUGH THE SECOND!

DOWN!

DOWN!

THROUGH THE CREW'S QUARTERS!

THROUGH THE ENGINE ROOMS!

SMASHING THROUGH HIS OWN LITTLE CABIN!

AND DOWN THROUGH THE STEEL HULL OF THE SHIP!

STILL DOWN...!

DEEPER,

DEEPER INTO THE MURKY DEPTHS,

TILL..........

SMASH!  into into the sea bed, sinking a 37' shaft in the process.

Desperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface.

Up and up, desperate, gasping....

Out of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng wild with acclaim.

HERO!  WONDERFUL!  AMAZING!  BLOODY GOOD SHOW WHAT!

And handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over the crowd.

""Well tramp, I have *NEVER* seen anything like that, *EVER*. That was the most *STUPENDOUS* piece of diving I have ever seen""

The tramp blushed.

The captain went on:

""But tell me; most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it.""

And the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly:

""Well you see I'm a poor tramp so you must understand...

I've been through many a hardship in my life""",5615,2018-06-18 14:52:50,Jokes,RooR_,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/8rznt9/there_was_this_tramp/,/r/Jokes/comments/8rznt9/there_was_this_tramp/,8rznt9,"No kidding about that ""Long"" label",CA[deleted],1931,2018-06-18 13:11:23.442159

"Hello Brains! We're How to ADHD, a YouTube channel that helps ADHD brains (and the hearts who love them!) better understand ADHD! Ask us anything!","Hi there!  We are Jessica and Edward, the producing partners of How to ADHD, a YouTube show Jessica created in 2016. We also happen to be married! We focus on using compassion, humor, and evidence-based research to help people understand, work with, and love their ADHD brains.  Our channel is http://youtube.com/howtoadhd

Jessica is the creator and host of the channel – she researches, writes, and performs all the episodes.  Edward directs, edits, and animates them. That's the official description, anyway, we tend to collaborate on all aspects of the show.

We've created over a hundred How to ADHD videos, we did a TEDx talk in 2017 that's been seen [more than ten million times](https://www.facebook.com/howtoadhd/posts/488810248149803), and in December 2017, we became full-time content creators, thanks to the generous support of our patrons on Patreon. (http://patreon.com/howtoadhd) 

Jessica also speaks about ADHD and mental health at events (like VidCon! We'll be there this week!) and on podcasts, and we generally do our best to help everyone understand what ADHD really is, and how to adapt to the challenges and appreciate the strengths of the ADHD brain. We're excited to be here, ask us anything!

In this episode the captain takes a vacation on Earth to recover at his family's vineyard that is inhabited by his overbearing, old fashioned brother, Robert.

"You can pay for school, but you can't buy class","LTL;FTP, mobile, TL;DR at the end, all that stuff.       

I've been sitting on this one for awhile waiting for the dust to settle. Names have been changed and details omitted to avoid any potential HIPAA violations. Brace yourself, it's a long one, and it really doesn't have a happy ending.       

An undisclosed amount of time ago, I worked in a  short term/acute mental health facility. I worked with some amazing people; both staff and clients. And while we were intended for the milder side of mental health, we had the whole spectrum, from mild depression, to full-blown psychosis, The clients were mostly referred through the county mental health agency(MHA), which had a contract with our facility that gave them the legal equivalent of dibsies on all but one of our available beds.     

Here's how it worked: We were responsible for the client's basic needs; food, water, shelter, safety, dispensing meds as prescribed, etc.
The MHA was responsible for everything else. Client has an appointment? MHA arranges transportation. Client needs meds refilled? MHA picks up and pays for the refills. MHA also made decisions about the restrictions being placed on the client such as level of supervision, permission to leave the facility unsupervised, official discharges from the facility, etc.       

Most of the social workers understood the way things worked, would listen to our concerns, and more often than not, would follow up with our suggestions. And while they didn't always agree with us, most of them would at least hear us out and address our concerns. *Most of them.* There was one social worker who everyone hated. Let's call her UC, for unbearable cunt. UC just couldn't get it through her head why we couldn't do things her way to make her life easier.        


UC: Why can't you just pick up the meds?      
Me: We don't do that. We---- (getting cut off)    
UC: (shrieks) WHY NOT?!       
Me: Well for starters, I have to stay here with the clients you've placed in our care, especially [our latest client] who isn't supposed to leave my sight, and really needs their meds.      
UC: (*REALLY* pissed off now) I didn't get a Master's Degree just to stand in line at the pharmacy!          
Me: No, ma'am. You signed up for that when you took the job with MHA.       
UC: Hangs up on me.
          
That's just one example of the UC's bullshit. She treated our people like idiots, waving her Master's Degree around, ignoring any of our observations on client behavior. Client is having increased symptoms? Oh, when did you get a Master's Degree? Client needs a higher level of care? I wasn't aware that you were qualified to make that assessment.  Never mind that we're required to have several years experience and/or a Bachelor's Degree in psychology to do this job. I mostly just brushed it off. She got on my nerves, but so did a lot of people in that line of work, so you better know how to brush shit off.          

Now for the catalyst.      

We get a client in. Nothing new. We know the client pretty well, usually comes to us once or twice a year, stays a couple weeks, then goes home. Except that this time, client comes in for a few weeks, is home for a week, then comes back. Client had been in our facility several times over a span of only a couple of months. One day, client looks at me and asks, ""Why do I still feel like I want to go and [commit suicide]?""       
I do my best to utilize my suicide intervention training, and document the shit out everything. I call MHA and make them aware of the situation. Later on that day, client is trying to get ahold of their counselor. Then their social worker. Then anyone who will listen. I do what I can, but I can't give the answers they're looking for. I go to my boss and ask her to get someone from MHA to come in and see the client today. Yes, boss. It has to be today. Client is freaking out and I'm barely holding things together in there because I can't give the answers that client is looking for. Boss calls and someone will be by ""later."" No time frame, but it will be today. Client is blowing up MHA's phone trying to find out when they're going to be there, isn't getting a straight answer, and hits ""Fuck it.""      
Client makes one more call and says, ""I want to go home."" I hear this and red flags are going off and I have gone from professional concern to freaking the fuck out because this client is looking to leave and commit suicide. I start going through my documentation from the day and highlight all of the powerful elements that really point out that this client is suicidal. I go and let my boss know that client is looking to leave now, and is still suicidal. It's important because this was a voluntary placement, and technically the client could've walked out the door right then and there and there wasn't anything I could do to stop them.     

Finally one of the MHA people shows up, under instructions to discharge client. I take the person aside to speak with them in my boss's office, explain that client is suicidal, needs to be put on a psychiatric hold; and needs a higher level of care; a secure facility at the very least. MHA agent agrees completely, but is under instruction from her boss to discharge the client. She also does not have the authority to place the client on a hold. UC would have to do it. MHA calls UC to come in and UC throws a fit. I could hear her shriek through the phone, from halfway across the room, ""YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO SEND [CLIENT] HOME!""       

UC comes in and I'm there waiting with the client chart in hand, trying to bring her up to speed, and she just completely blows me off like I'm not even there. Goes in, talks to client, asks the same questions she asks before discharging anyone, and tells client to get packed. At this point, I'm pretty sure there's steam shooting out of my ears I was so pissed. I pull her into my boss's office and proceed to give the same speech I gave the other MHA worker. UC blows me off and refers to her Master's Degree again, and I officially lost my shit. Something along the lines of, I've spent 40 hrs a week with this client. You've been here 5 fucking minutes. If you send [client] home, [client] will be dead by the end of the day.""         

I let my boss know that I need a break and she tells me to take my time and she had. it covered. I walked down the street and probably smoked a half a pack of cigarettes before I calmed down enough to speak without swearing again. When I got back, client is gone. Boss tells me that I did what I could, but it's not my decision to make, tries to reassure me that I did everything right except for swearing at UC, but she won't let it be held against me. I finished out my shift, still steaming a bit when I clicked out.      

The next day I get a call from client's mom and she's asking me what happened. I let her know that client discharged yesterday, so I don't know anything more than that. Client's mom snaps, ""Well [client]'s dead!""         
Instantly I'm pissed again. I fucking told them that this would happen. I ask client's mom to hang on for a second and I check the documents for client. Awesome. I have an Release of Information filled out for the mom that gives me permission to let her know anything and everything about client, and it expires 30 days after discharge. Perfect. I told her everything. The calls to MHA, the suicidal comments, the attempt by myself and the other MHA staff to put client on a hold and placed in a secure facility, UC blowing us off and sending client home. Let her know that it's all very well documented and there will likely be an investigation. Client's mom is in tears and thanks me, and says, ""There will definitely be an investigation.""       

Afterwards, I go to my boss, let her know that client's mom called, client is dead, I let her know what happened the day before, and that I will be reporting UC for neglect. Boss says, ""We're mandatory reporters. You're pretty much obligated to report that."" And. gives me the name and email of the person to contact.       

The aftermath: Client's mom sued MHA, and UC specifically, for wrongful death. She won a pretty large settlement, and MHA takes our concerns much more seriously now. UC lost her license to be a social worker. Last time I saw her she was getting fired from a department store, while screaming about her Master's Degree.  

TL;DR: Suicidal person gets sent home from mental health facility by self-righteous social worker, and commits suicide. Social worker gets investgated for neglect, gets the shit sued out of her, and loses her license to be a social worker.

During it, investigators learned a parolee with sexual assault convictions was on campus at the time of the alleged attack. He denied any knowledge of the incident and passed a polygraph test.

At one point, Zolkowski told investigators she dropped her classes at Delta due to the attack, but police learned she had in fact dropped her classes prior to Feb. 22.

Tell the boss that you're overworked and that a certain project is too unwieldy and time-consuming for you to handle it on your own? I'll do that project in an afternoon.,"My incompetent coworker regularly complains how she doesn't have enough time to take care of her zillions of responsibilities. (Spoiler alert: she's just terrible at time management, along with the rest of her job.) 

Our boss met with us to discuss our difficulty working together (for me, it's her incompetence that's the problem; for her, it's the fact that I keep pointing out her incompetence). Coworker was asked how she could do some things better and she, of course, blamed everything on other people or situations beyond her control, such as her perceived heavy workload. 

So then boss asked her if there's anything coworker could offload to me to help the workload situation. Coworker said there was something (which she normally spends months on), and I agreed. She later met with me to show me what the thing is--and mind you, 90% of this process is brand new to me--and I finished it in 2.5 hours. I didn't even devise a better way, I just sat down and did it until it was finished and didn't complain about having to do actual work. I did it well and I did it quickly, though honestly I could have paced myself and maybe taken 4 hours to do it.

The best thing is, coworker has no earthly clue that all this does is make her look even more incompetent. I'm pretty sure when boss meets with us again tomorrow (less than a week after the first meeting), he'll reiterate that I'm to be helping her with the thing I promised to take off her plate which takes her months to do, and I'll get to say,""Yeah, I did that already. It took me under three hours.""

TL;DR: Yes, incompetent coworker, I'll do your ""huge"" job responsibility for you, but I'll work my tail off to do it in no time at all and make you look like a buffoon in the process.

"You say you only called the boss out of concern for my well being? Well being that you called him, I had to follow suit.","A few weeks ago, my coworker (CW) was negating some minor protocols which left some equipment down overnight. He also didn't send emails to some of our remote teams regarding downed equipment. So, I did him a solid (or so I thought) and sent him and *only* him an email telling him what he did wrong. The very next night, he did it again and I brought it up to him again.....cuz no one wants to be a snitch to the boss, right? Wrong.

The very next day, I failed to charge my phone and woke up to realize that my phone was dead and I was late for work so I got dressed and boogied my sorry ass to work, which was only a 5 minute walk for me. I apologized for being 50 minutes late and he seemed cool about it....until I found out that he called the boss after only 25 minutes, something no one on our team had ever done in my years of working here, claiming he was just concerned for my ""well being"". Even my boss told him to just wait it out and that he was sure that it was just an accident and that it happens sometimes, cuz he's fucking cool like that. 

My boss even told me afterwards that it was no big deal and couldn't imagine why CW would call him, at 7:10 in the morining, on a Saturday, when there was literally nothing he could do about it. Then he asked me about a piece of equipment that got left down for 6 +hours so I had to come clean. I told him that I sent coworker an email about it and then it happened again the next day. He asked me to forward the emails to him so he could address them with CW. He also asked me not to ""shield"" CW from incidents like this because it made the whole team look bad and he needed to address it with CW personally.

So now, everytime I catch a mistake CW makes, which is far more often than I thought, I forward the information directly to the boss so he can see first hand all the mistakes CW makes.

I haven't talked to CW much since the incident. I am curious about his well being though.",2060,2018-06-21 12:30:35,pettyrevenge,fixerofthings,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/8sr3o8/you_say_you_only_called_the_boss_out_of_concern/,/r/pettyrevenge/comments/8sr3o8/you_say_you_only_called_the_boss_out_of_concern/,8sr3o8,"I'm a humble bartender at the moment, but for months now I've gone out of my way to help the other staff around me, including managers; in particular for this one manager multiple times I've gone and got the keys for her, locked up all the crap she forgot to and then re-signed them in to the secure store overnight, a few weeks ago though she decided to start being excessively petty about the minor shit (Not carrying a dirty teacup to the kitchen on a tray because I had no tray at the time, turning up 7 minutes late because it was fucking pouring it down and I cycle 10 miles in.) so I just stopped doing all the extra helpful stuff when she's on duty. No more restaurant clearing, no more taking food out, no more clearing down and resetting function rooms, and best of all the other night she forgot to lock up *again*, came through in a huff, confirmed she had already checked in the keys and left the storage cellar completely unlocked (storage is next to our check-out/cloakroom, it's just convenient she can 'discover' it right next to me so I can offer to run to the other side of the block)...and just sort of stood there for several long seconds while I shrugged and carried on getting out of uniform.

[USA-NY] 24 year old male. My doctor called and told my mother he treated my genital warts,"I had one genital wart removed and my insurance covered it fully. Later my doctor kept pushing for a skin biopsy on my chest that was completely irrelevant to my genital wart. 
I finally agreed and signed the paper after he told me how risky it could be for cancer. He performed the procedure but the nurse forgot to verify that the insurance is covering it. I understand I need to pay because I signed paperwork saying I'd be responsible if my insurance didn't pay. 

However he called my mother introducing himself as the doctor who treated my genital warts. Then he goes on to tell her he needs a few thousand dollars for the procedure. 

Is that even legal? I thought he wasn't allowed to reveal another condition unless it comes down to the insurance not paying. 

I literally told the doctor my family couldn't know about the wart and he tried to use it against me to scare me and my mom into paying immediately. My insurance kicked me off for doing so many unnecessary procedures with this guy. He would convince me everything could potentially be cancerous. 

I understand it's my fault for not doing my research and being gullible so I'll have to pay for that. However I'm pretty upset he had to tell my mom about my STI condition when there was no issue with the billing. He was paid and it was done over a year ago. It was completely irrelevant to his call to collect. He called to collect from a skin biopsy of a mole on my chest.

"Youtuber ""Potates"" completely plagiarized a post I made on r/Fallout about Fallout 76, and passed it off as his own work. The video is now at 800k views.","**EDIT 2:**

I had no idea that this thread would blow up in the way that it has -- I only posted here to begin with because a buddy of mine posts here and he said it would be good to share, and maybe get some exposure for the original post. I am pretty overwhelmed with the amount of people who are taking an interest in this and I want to make it abundantly clear that I do not and will not ever support anybody who is dishing out threats and personal attacks against Potates. Be better than that. Thanks.

Potates has DM'd be acknowledging the mistake, and does not deserve to be harassed and threatened over this. He has been cool about the whole situation and I am willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, and be cool back. Neither he nor I knew just how crazy this situation was going to get. Again, I am asking you from the bottom of my heart, do not lash out at Potates.

-------------------

Link to the Potates video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t26s5aMSBWY

Link to my post, which he reads (mostly) verbatim off in his video without any credit to me, or even that it is a post from reddit, whatsoever: https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/8qsx8s/complete_notes_from_the_noclip_documentary/

\^That's a massive Fallout 76 info dump based on the Noclip documentary that had a strong community reaction, and got passed around a lot. It took me a while to write up as I watched the documentary, and I spent a non-trivial amount of time making as it clear and concise as possible, using direct quotes whenever possible. Shout out to when he misread one of my points that said camps are saved as blueprints, and accidentally said ""served as blueprints"" which is a nonsensical statement.

He starts his video off at the ""Gameplay"" section of my post, and at the beginning switches up his verbiage a little bit so it's not too obvious. As the video goes on, that stops quickly, and he starts reading every single bullet point almost verbatim. I'm not *too* upset because I'm glad more people got to see the information, but I am a little irritated that he passes it off as his own work. He reads the post like it was his script! Even the way he does the voice over makes it sound as if he is saying these things off the cuff, when in reality he is reading off the words I wrote from a page.  I only found this video at all because I clicked it and wanted to hear new Fallout 76 information -- a minute or two in, I realized that I had heard those words before... because I wrote them!

I'm passionate about video games, and love to write about them, even though I'm not a professional. So to see something you've written being plagiarized after putting in time and effort to share that written content with people just hurts a little bit. When you're looking for more opportunities to write in a way that will attract attention, seeing somebody else take that attention can really suck.

Here's the thing. If he had shot me a message saying ""hey man, I'd like to quote this post in a video"", I'd have said go for it 100%. If at the beginning of the video he had said something like ""hey guys I found this post on reddit I'd like to read you"", I'd be fine with that. But the fact that he passes this off as if he wrote it all, or as if he took the time to compile this information is definitely frustrating to me. I feel like I put in the work for this, and then this guy turned around and monetized it without even having the decency to acknowledge that it wasn't his. 




EDIT: I see a lot of you commenting on the video saying that he has stolen my content. Unfortunately, it appears as if he is deleting all of those comments as they come in.

Sony is the major competitor for Nintendo in Japan, and the major competitor for the Xbox in the west. Moreover Nintendo's increasingly got a mobile-focused product line, with the Switch covering such a different set of bases from the Xbox that even ignoring market differences they inherently compete less with each other than they used to.

And of course, crossplay makes multiplayer servers that much more populated, which makes the community livelier, which makes it easier to sell games and consoles. It seems like a gentleman's agreement to let the consoles compete on their own merits while overall trying to increase the size of the total market.

Don't use a Mandolin without a guard unless you want to make roasted fingertips too.

Also, people up your flavor game!!  Tone it down on the bacon (I know, how dare I but seriously bacon isn't the only flavor in the world even though it's delicious).  Or keep the bacon, I don't give a shit but PLEASE throw some fresh herbs in (personal favorite for dinner is rosemary and thyme, toss that shit in with the spices and oil to roast with the potatoes and onions), use fresh ground pepper (you'll never go back to boxed, fine grind stuff again and it's cheap as hell.  You can even reuse grinder container from some prepackaged herb or salt blends like Trader Joes has, I've been using one for years (not pretty but works damn well) for my pepper and bulk whole peppers can be bought and stored for super cheap), and try some red onions!!

I like the recipe OP and I'm damn sure going to try your technique.  I normally cute into chunks and roast because I like the herbs and spices all over each bite (and the crunch when all 4 side are perfectly crisp! Hot damn!) but I like the presentation of this and I'm interested to see how it turns.

Success of blood test for autism affirmed,"This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://news.rpi.edu/content/2018/06/19/success-blood-test-autism-affirmed) reduced by 76%. (I'm a bot)
*****
> &quot;We looked at groups of children with ASD independent from our previous study and had similar success. We are able to predict with 88 percent accuracy whether children have autism,&quot; said Juergen Hahn, lead author, systems biologist, professor, head of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Department of Biomedical Engineering, and member of the Rensselaer Center for Biotechnology and Interdisciplinary Studies.

> Rather than search for a sole indicator of ASD, the approach Hahn developed uses big data techniques to search for patterns in metabolites relevant to two connected cellular pathways with suspected links to ASD. &quot;Juergen&#039;s work in developing a physiological test for autism is an example of how the interdisciplinary life science-engineering interface at Rensselaer brings new perspectives and solutions to improve human health,&quot; said Deepak Vashishth, CBIS director.

> The initial success in 2017 analyzed data from a group of 149 people, about half of whom had been previously diagnosed with ASD. For each member of the group, Hahn obtained data on 24 metabolites related to the two cellular pathways-the methionine cycle and the transsulfuration pathway.

> To avoid the lengthy process of gathering new data through clinical trials, Hahn and his team searched for existing datasets that included the metabolites he had analyzed in the original study.

> The researchers identified appropriate data from three different studies that included a total of 154 children with autism conducted by researchers at the Arkansas Children&#039;s Research Institute.

> The data included only 22 of the 24 metabolites he used to create the original predictive algorithm, however Hahn determined the available information would be sufficient for the test.

Is accepting celibate homosexuals really accepting them?,"I'm sure other denominations have this view, but Catholicism in particular takes the stance that BEING homosexual is not in-and-of-itself a sin, but that engaging in homosexual behavior is.

as the catechism states >2357 Homosexuality refers to relations between men or between women who experience an exclusive or predominant sexual attraction toward persons of the same sex. It has taken a great variety of forms through the centuries and in different cultures. Its psychological genesis remains largely unexplained. Basing itself on Sacred Scripture, **which presents homosexual acts as acts of grave depravity**,141 tradition has always declared that ""homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered.""142 **They are contrary to the natural law. They close the sexual act to the gift of life.** They do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity. Under no circumstances can they be approved.


I can't help but feel this is a cop out stance of the church. Homosexuals are inclined to engage in homosexual behavior. You can't say you support a painter, only if he doesn't paint...because the point of a painter is that he paints! By supporting a celibate homosexual, you are not supporting a homosexual, only celibacy.


If your church wants to maintain this position, then why not just fully ban homosexuals from being part of the church. What's the point?

"My Landlord has been unreasonably slow at replacing a broken refrigerator- what are my options? Denver, CO","So on June 1st I moved into a new place in Denver. Really great old victorian mansion divided up into apartments. When I took possession of the property, I realized the fridge was unplugged. No worries. I plugged it back in and it got cold and I loaded it up with groceries. 

The next day, the fridge is completely warm and most of my food is spoiled. This is the top floor of an old building so it gets really hot. I let my landlord know the fridge was broken and he gave me a minifridge and claimed he contacted the manufacturer for information about the warranty.

After about 5 days of asking him what was going on with the warranty and receiving only vague ""I'll keep you posted"" texts, the minifridge he provided failed and barely worked better than a cooler.

Then, after about 10 days fridgeless, I told him I would contact a repair person to come look at it. I found the top rated appliance person on yelp, she looked up the fridge make and model and told me it was essentially impossible to find parts for and was the cheapest, most unreliable fridge on the market. Someone came by, reset the fridge, and it worked fine for a few days. I filled it up with groceries once again only to have the fridge break almost immediately and once again spoil lots of food. Thankfully I have a receipt. 

My girlfriend happens to know the previous tenants of the unit I'm living in, and apparently right as they were moving out the fridge failed. They told the landlord, and he unplugged it and ignored it until we told him.

It has now been three weeks of living without any proper refrigeration. I have had over $150 worth of food spoil, and have been eating ramen and pasta to survive. I have been calling my landlord every day for updates about his supposed repair and warranty, and he either blocks my calls or responds to my texts with a short ""I'll keep you posted"".

At this point I am considering legal action to get a new fridge and possibly a reimbursement for the food I have lost. What are my options? I am in Denver, CO.

TL;DR: Fridge broke before I moved into unit, landlord knew and didn't fix or replace it and has been seemingly ignoring me when I try to have him deal with it.",1,2018-06-22 05:01:13,legaladvice,BjornToDie,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8sycn1/my_landlord_has_been_unreasonably_slow_at/,/r/legaladvice/comments/8sycn1/my_landlord_has_been_unreasonably_slow_at/,8sycn1,"Please review the [Landlord Tenant Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/landlord) section of the /r/LegalAdvice Wiki for common questions and answers regarding landlord tenant issues.

"[USA-OR]Co-worker never shows up to work, protected by doctor's note?","Hello, I'm hoping to get some insight on this issue, as it's directly affecting me and my other co-workers and I'd like to settle once and for all if anything can be done about it.

There are three tiers in my office, my boss, myself and about 7 others, and around 40 others below us. This particular co-worker is mid-tier, on par with me. In my line of work, the mid-tier is depended upon the most. If someone in my tier doesn't show up, the others scheduled that day have to pick up the slack and it creates a lot of extra stress. This normally isn't an issue with the one-off day and someone calls in sick. However, this co-worker calls in at minimum, 10 times a month. As a result, there is a lot of extra stress, work, and resentment among the employees that do show up regularly.

They have a medical issue and will constantly use that as an excuse for their call offs. Now, I'm not a monster, I understand that there are some people with health issues that cannot be helped, however, if they're in a line of work that is detrimental to their health...I start to lose sympathy.

I would like to note that we have a policy that you must call 2 hours ahead of your shift to notify the manager that you won't be making it in; this is rarely the case with this co-worker. On top of that, because of their days scheduled, they are considered full-time, so they have access to benefits. To put this in perspective, I have another co-worker (also mid-tier) who works part time and also has health issues. The difference is they shows up to all of their shifts, but had insurance/healthcare taken away because they only work 2 days a week.

Our HR department says they can't touch them because of their doctor's note that fully protects them from being fired, is this true? Can an employee truly bypass the system (my company is an at will employer) completely with a doctor's note?

If you're feeling really knowledgeable, what will the new Oregon law about predictive scheduling (my company qualifies) mean for them? Thank you for any/all help.

I learned how to build for nothing pretty much. A touching story below. Maybe,"I remember way back when, when materials were so abundant that I would build stairs or walls just to do it. Or make wild unimaginable bridges across the river instead going into that Death Valley. And we will never forget when the willow trees have 50+ wood for three hits.  This was all on those good ol combat pro controls. Then came around the builder pro controls. Never switched because I still built better than many people. Created a muscle memory and became better at the game. Was beaten by someone and messaged them afterwards. They talked me into builder pro. I then created a complete new muscle memory and it was an extreme amount of fun. Completely new way of playing. Still an abundance of materials. Time went on and the game added more and more fun things to do within game. Building got faster from the hop rocks. I’d play this game 30+ hours a week. 

Now with all the nerfs building has slown down or in better words become more scarce because you have to be smarter with the amount of materials you use. I learned a way of playing which was the main part of this game. Building. Making forts. At night with my squad. Fortnite. One of the best games of this decade. And now I have to unlearn everything I’ve learned about building or swing my pickaxe at trees three times as much. Which personally just isn’t for me. 

This game was the best now I have other choices in front of fortnite. I play fortnite maybe 1-4 hours a week.

Help defining a fetish,"So I have this fetish... or craving... or need or whatever... First I need to define it, second to find a subreddit for it. 

I LOVE it when a woman is wearing a pair of baggy pants that sag low generally on one side where it drops below their waste band and you see their underwear. Expressly when you see the skin beneath the underwear  the leg or hip. 

I absolutely rave and go out of my mind when my S/o used to wear that and I would love to find a whole album of it.

I hate the people that like me too much,"I try to be very polite, respectful to people and generally act like a nice guy because I don't like being negative for no reason. This whole polite to everybody thing gets certain types of people that really like me, though I find some of these people pathetic in the way they try to gain my affection, platonicly. They act so bashful and apologize for every little thing they do because they want me to like them and get nervous when they think I might not. 
These people are usually slower people or younger people and occasionally people with a more troubled past so to some extent their want for that company is justified, but I get so furious at it for some reason.
 I don't lash at them or anything cause again that'd be a really big dick move but it just pissess me off so much for some reason and I just get lesser opinions of them for some reason.
I don't wanna seem pretentious by saying everyone likes me like that, cause I don't see myself like that and I don't want people to think I do. There are just some people who like the mood I give off I guess and I hate when they try too hard for me it just make me so mad.

Sponsorship's changing to Memberships question,"So, I just read the article YouTube released about them changing the ""Sponsorships"" that channels already have to ""Channel Memberships."" (https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7636690)

My question: I was hoping to get monetization back within the next 9 days (looks like approvals are being sent out in waves) and I was hoping to activate my Sponsor button, whether it be on my channel normally or on YouTube Gaming, as I mainly stream. It states on the article that Channel Memberships will only be available for channels with over 100,000 subscribers. I currently have 7.4k. If I'm able to activate my button if I get my monetization back before the end of the month, will I be able to keep my button or will it be removed? /:

"[SIB] Doom, Prey, GTA V, MGS V, Rise of Tomb Raider","Pick 2 of the above from my wishlist.They are all relatively similar in price.

Some notes:

Doom: I love FPS but shy away from horror. But due to the high ratings I would want to try this one day.

Prey: Word on the street is that it's similar to Deus Ex: HR. I liked that game, but didn't love it.

GTA V: Played 3 & 4 but didn't catch my attention long enough to complete them. But the reviews for the latest iteration have convinced me to give it another go. Adding mission checkpoints was a huge plus for me.

MGS V: completed all previous main titles and liked them but don't care too much about the story.

ROTW: Won't regret buying this but I know it will play out like typical ubisoft games and similar to the first game

Hey there Space Cowboys and -girls,we just wanted to let you know what we're working on currently, and say thank you for all the great reviews coming in recently. It's really fantastic to see new and old players adding their voices and letting others know what's to like about 3030. These reviews are helping other players discover the game, and they also make it possible for us to keep working on the game, adding new content and new features to the 3030 universe.So in terms of that, what are some of the things we're working on currently you ask? Well, let's see... There is going to be an updated ship buy screen, improved nebula effects, a much cooler nebula map, improved dynamic zoom effects, an improved intro, better turning jet look & placement, a cool new nebula radar (that you can see in the image above) aaand... some new outfits for Falcon! You'll be able to get a bunch of new outfits, and even can take that old hat off your noggin if you so choose.Besides these, we'll also be further improving Mod support, this time focusing on making missions and custom quests more moddable. We've already seen some cool weapon and ship mods being made, and there are some custom quests in the making. We hope to improve the modding API for these, so it's easier for creators to set up new story lines of their own, thus adding even more depth to the 3030 world.And finally, we also have a long running project of improving the game's combat, as some players have pointed out that you tend to resort to the same tactics each time. We'll be trying to spice things up a bit and add some variety, but these features are still very much Work In Progress, so we can't give any ETA on that yet.Also, perhaps you've noticed already: There's a new trailer for the game, this time with a really cool Voice Over. If you want to check it out, it's the first video in the gallery above.And our last announcement: For this year's Steam Summer Sale, we'll be discounting the game to 50%, our biggest discount yet! Our goal, as we've said before, is to get the game to 500 reviews, and we think offering such a big discount during the year's biggest sale is a good way to get there! So if there's anyone you know who would enjoy a good Space Odyssey, please spread the word!Thanks again for all your feedback, it's what has motivated all these upcoming features, and an extra Thank You to everyone who has left a review, it's what is making these additional features and updates possible!

[US-AZ] Question about potential medical malpractice.,"Preface: I know nothing of the legal system or what is/isn’t accepted. I’d like an accurate/honest opinion of the situation, not sympothy. I’ll be as objective as possible in my description of events, but I’m not in a happy place right now.

This is regarding my wife. About a month ago, she started having daily headaches. After a week or so, vision started to go. Started out like looking at the sun too long, very splotchy, for lack of a better word. We assumed it was related to the migraines, as I had had this happen before. After a few days, it didn’t go away and her vision started getting darker. 

Queue trip 1 to the ER. We go through triage and they also find out she’s gained a lot of weight in the last month. She’s also started taking a new birth control, which can result in pituitary issues. They schedule an MRI. They find a small cyst on the pituitary, but it shouldn’t be affecting vision. They wanted to consult a neurosurgeon, but theirs was out of town. They discharged us and said to follow up with PCP/Other Hospital within a day or two, but it’s not really an emergency at this point, just make sure to do it (their words). This was on a Saturday. PCP closed, spoke to them on Monday. Earliest appointment we could get was that Thursday. Called the neurosurgeon/neurologist the first hospital gave us the number for. Earliest appointment was in July (we called on June 11th), but they said we can keep trying for cancellations. Another day passes, vision gets worse and headaches are worse. 

Queue trip to 2nd hospital, affiliate of Hospital 1 with a neurosurgeon on call. Go through Triage within an hour. Spend 4 more hours in the waiting room. Check with receptionist, still 6 people ahead of us. Spoke to another person waiting, they were there 2 hours before us and had 3 people ahead of them. At this point, we get the impression they are not treating this like an emergency, matched what hospital 1 said anyway. Wife decides we should leave, as they also have ambulances coming in every hour, kicking everyone back. We have a PCP appointment in 2 days, she decided to just stick it out and see if we could get directly to a neurologist through them. Wednesday rolls around and worst migraine she’s had yet comes up.

Queue trip 3 to the ER. Unaffiliate with others. Wife had surgery here before, pretty good reputation. Get through triage quickly. We explain the symptoms and repeatedly tell them it’s not the migraines causing vision loss. It’s happening along side it. Ask them to please not treat it as a migraine with vision loss. Check for something else. CT was done. They didn’t see anything on the CT while there. Treated it as a migraine with vision loss anyway (I saw the chart on the computer, said exactly that) and treatment included Benodryl and Haldol. Haldol, on someone who had not taken any uppers and has severe depression, which was told to them multiple times. Wife proceeds to beg me to let her kill herself throughout the night. They recommend keeping the PCP appointment the following day.

Thursday rolls around. No changes in Neurologist schedule. Hospital 3 calls back. Turns out there’s a thrombosis inn her head that may be causing the issues. They recommend recalling to hospital 3 ER and they said they’d call ahead to get her in ASAP. PCP gives us the number of Hospital 3’s neurosurgeon and the original one we were referred to.

Queue second trip to hospital 3 ER. Triage is quick and they say they’re waiting on a room. 3 hours in the waiting room and several people taken back that came in and were triaged after us, we can see how high a priority we are. We get in touch with the first recommended neurologist and they have a cancellation, can get us in by Monday. 

Weekend. Vision is almost fully gone. Left eye is completely dark. Roght eye can kind of see after focusing for a while, but it’s really dark (vision was like this in Triage on Thursday). Headaches don’t change and vision can’t really get worse, plus I’ve missed almost a full week of work at this point. Wife powers through on excedrin and ibuprofen for the weekend.

Queue Neurologist appointment. Neurologist sees her, does some tests, including vision. After vision, he does a double take and shines the light in again. His exact words are “Holy shit! You’re not getting any light in there”

Finally. Someone who takes this serious. He proceeds to treat this like the emergency it is. He stays 30-40 minutes after closing calling various ERs to get us a bed and LP that night. No waiting anymore. He thinks it is increased spinal fluid pushing on the optic nerve, likely caused by the thrombosis. The cyst on the pituitary is no where big enough to cause total vision loss. No beds available at hospital 3, so we end up at hospital 1. Taken to a room alost immediately. Pain is treated as needed and an LP is done by someone called in by the neurologist. LP goes awful. Extremely painful, takes forever to get in the right place, and can’t get an accurate measure because they had to do it with her sitting up, but they do drain some. No change to headaches/vision. Later that night, she’s transferred to hospital 3 for the thrombosis.

Queue this week, a week of hell.
Tuesday: catheters are put in from the groin to the brain to deliver clot busting meds. She has to lay on her back and be restrained to keep from pulling them.
Wednesday: day 2 of my wife only allowed on her back. She is a large woman. Now she has constant back pain and can’t breathe, but she needs to make it through. The catheters can’t move.
Thursday (today): catheters removed and thrombosis is gone. Neurosurgeon recommends an LP tube due to continued pressure and no change to vision. LP tube done. Wife screaming in agony as it drains about head pain. Initial LP draw was clear-ish, some red in it. Drain is nothing but blood. Goes on for an hour or two. Neurosurgen has another CT done. Now there’s a bleed in her brain. Immediate surgery needed.

As of right now, I’m waiting for her to return from surgery. The issue is no longer about sight, it’s about whether she will live or not and what permanent damage has been done due to how long the pressure was there and the brain hemorrhage.

A few notes: yes, we waited an oddly long time to go somewhere, but headaches happen, or so we assumed, and were easy enough to get rid of. Vision loss we didn’t really treat as an emergency because nobody else was. Yes, we left the ER without treatment at hospital 2, but the wait time was outrageous and nobody seemed to care.

Who is responsible for this clusterfuck of headaches to blind and fighting for her life in the course of 2 weeks? Is it us? Is it the hospitals? Maybe the doctors not being able to diagnose what was happening or not fixing it fast enough?

I needed something to type up during this wait for surgery, as it’s awful. Any opinions are welcomed, whether it’s our fault or not.",1,2018-06-22 05:00:59,legaladvice,ixoHawkeyeoxi,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8sycl4/usaz_question_about_potential_medical_malpractice/,/r/legaladvice/comments/8sycl4/usaz_question_about_potential_medical_malpractice/,8sycl4,"Malpractice of any kind is very fact specific and it is unfortunately beyond the scope of this subreddit.  If this is a medical question, it is highly recommended to speak with a medical malpractice attorney; your state's bar may be able to refer you to one. They typically work on contingency, meaning there is little up front cost to you. Similarly, consultations are typically free. It wouldn't hurt to meet with one, have them look over your info, and go from there.  

If this is a question about legal malpractice, you should seek the advice of a second unrelated attorney and/or report the matter to your state bar association""

"Canadians, watch out for ANS's ""free"" shipping","Usually it has been fine, they ship most their stuff via USPS and all is good.

However, last time I had an order big enough for ""free shipping"", they decided to send it via Fed Ex without asking or giving any option (or even warning). You will get DESTROYED by FedEx fees, they charge you your first AND second born for handling fees at the border. There's a reason no sane person uses courier companies to cross the border unless they are desperate for speed. ANS did not ask, and shipping ended up being nearly 50% more on top of the actual price. So much for ""free"" shipping...

> Even as the Trump administration sides with big internet service providers in setting the stage for major changes in the way consumers are billed for going online, New York is among a handful of states actively fighting back.

> Everything from student homework to entertainment and vital government and insurance services is being done digitally these days.

> Under a new Federal Communications Commission rule, access could be broken into tiers, with slower speeds for some services.

> Taken to an extreme, a company like Altice, which owns both Optimum Online, which has a near-monopoly on the South Fork, and Newsday, could put the brakes on competing media, such as The New York Times.

> AT&T, which is set to take over Time Warner, could throttle down the streaming service of competing Fox News while boosting CNN. The New York State Legislature passed a bill this week to try to protect equal access to the internet.

> It would prohibit state and local governments from using the services of companies that did not adhere to the principles of net neutrality.

So I was sitting outside with Courtney on a smoke break (she doesn't smoke, but Courtney does. Courtney is her friend.) and Courtney told me that this guy named Tyrone has a crush on her. He was going around having people ask how old she was.
She also said that Courtney told them that she was engaged and then they stopped talking about it. 

She told me all of this just moments ago.

I am in my home office with the door locked, almost crying

Idk what to do or think
I might sleep in here tonight, I'm crying now and I'm just, a jealous man.

Please someone give some advice",1,2018-06-22 05:00:51,Marriage,SeeJaySannin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/8sycjz/im_freaking_out_please_help/,/r/Marriage/comments/8sycjz/im_freaking_out_please_help/,8sycjz,CB[deleted],CA[deleted],CS[deleted],2018-06-21 21:03:21.149636
Weird ass dream about an estranged aunt? Interpretations welcome.,"Sometimes my dreams make me wonder wtf is wrong with my subconscious x,D. Okay so, I have an aunt who quit talking to me and her brother (my dad) following a bunch of family drama over five years ago. I’m really not sure if she is just bitter because I got married and had a baby and she never did or if she found out that I also called APS on her because she was not a competent caregiver for my grandpa (last straw was that he fell down the stairs and broke his neck and she *picked him up and put him in an arm chair and left him there until morning before finally calling an ambulance* O.o )

So ANYWAY. That’s the back story. 

My dream was that I got an invitation in the mail that said “Are you a traitor?” At the top. And said she wanted to reach back out and make amends. She was going to host a Frog party. Where everyone gets a kit with rice-shaped frog eggs that will eventually hatch and become frogs. 

Only, when I got there and opened the kit, the eggs crawled up everyone’s arms and squirped into our pores. O.O my aunt’s dream-friend was like “this is fine. They’re not harmful.” And I was like “uh... okay?” 

There was a project going on in another room that I felt responsible for, so I was trying really hard to wrap it up before I could leave. 

Do frogs symbolize something? Wtf?

What's the best way to make getting lost in caves FUN to play through?,"Having played through more standard, old-school dungeon crawls, a lot of cave experiences end up like this:

> **DM:** There is a three way fork, paths labeled A, B, and C. Which way do you go?

> **Players:** Uhhh, since they all look the same, A.

> **DM:** A was wrong. You get into a fight, then find a dead end. Now what?

> **Players:** ...I guess we go back and check B?

> **DM:** B leads to another fork. Paths are B1, B2, and B3. Which way?

> **Players:** Zzzzzzz.

It ends up tedious and un-fun. The whole thing ends up an exercise in drawing out maps, rather than anything resembling enjoyable roleplay.

There's also the other way, where every fork has a sign you can follow to find the right way, but that goes too far and compresses a whole cave system down to ""you follow all the signs and get through"". A whole place, shrunk to a sentence. That can't be the only other option.

I still want to evoke the feeling of a labyrinthine place, but without making the whole thing tedious to actually play through. Does anyone have any experience with successfully abstracting that feeling of getting lost?

EXPENSIVE PREP COURSE,"Let me start off by explaining what path I am on right now. I am interested in joining WGU's new Computer Science BA program. But I do not qualify considering my age and not having the proper work experience because their school is designed for professionals already in the field.
I am currently studying for my COMPTIA A+ once I receive this CERT I will be eligible to join their Computer Science program. This has endulged me into the self study world and the vast research on how many certification routes there are out there.. big fan of Network Chuck... also big fan of procrastination leaving me frustrated on days I'm not in a routine. Self study is pretty hard.
So I thought I might make it easier on myself by looking up COMPTIA A+ prep courses and signed myself up for an interview at PCAGE Career institue in NEW JERSEY. They offer a regionally accredited 30 credit program - 54 weeks/1Yr - 960 hours of hands on IT training. With test vouchers/books included for 

COMPTIA A, NETWORK, SECURITY, LINUX
MCSA
CCENT // CCNA 
CASP
CEH 

All for a whopping $21,000.
1 year. 4 hour/3 nights a week.

My logic is this. Since I'm already finding it hard to self study. How different is WGU going to be when it comes to procrastination... at a larger cost equaling out to the same cost possibly by the time I get WGU done .. in 3 Years maybe.. 

Maybe I'm being pessimistic about WGU after I've been motivated.. maybe I need someones advice.. this is why I'm posting here. On the brochure there is a quote of someone completing the program and transfering not 30.. but 39 credits to WGU afterwards to complete for a BA. 

Maybe I answered my question myself sitting here and typing it out.. but at the same time... maybe there are cheaper HANDS on alternatives... but are any as good as  8 CERTS they are advertising staring at the brochure as we speak.. in 1 YEAR?!

Thoughts? Comments?

I’m bi but feel like I can’t come out,"Hello reddit, like the title, I am bisexual. I’ve liked girls since I was in middle school but have always dated men. I didn’t really come out until a couple weeks ago and it was only to my boyfriend and close friend who were all happy for me and accept me. However, I feel like I can’t tell anyone else. My parents are conservative and religious, my brother is a stereotypical republican and I’m not super close with my cousins to have that discussion, I don’t know what to do because I feel like I have a secret identity I can’t tell people about. I’m also Catholic and feel like I can’t go to church anymore in fear of being judged if anyone found out. 

I know I’m just rambling, but I’d like some advice or reassurance because I feel like I’m in a dark, lonely place right now.

ATandT's WatchTV Is the First Streaming Service for the Post-Net Neutrality World,"This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://gizmodo.com/at-ts-watchtv-is-the-first-streaming-service-for-the-po-1827035425?IR=T) reduced by 67%. (I'm a bot)
*****
> Fresh off an apparently successful effort to gut a net neutrality bill in California, AT&T is taking a victory lap with the announcement of WatchTV, a skinny streaming TV bundle that finally shows us what the internet will look like without net neutrality protections.

> The Unlimited &More plan starts at $70 per month for a single line and offers users access to WatchTV for free, though the video streaming quality will be capped at 480p. Unlimited &More Premium starts at $80 per month for one line and unlocked 1080p video and 15GB of hotspot data.

> First off, as T-Mobile learned back in 2016 when it started offering its Binge On promotion, capping video streaming quality is considered a violation of net neutrality, as it basically amounts to throttling.

> Unless consumers are willing to pay an extra $10. Secondly, making its own streaming services available for free falls under the category of zero-rating, which the FCC once explicitly forbid back when it gave a shit about net neutrality.

> Zero-rating is the practice of providing a service that is free and exempted from data caps and is criticized by net neutrality advocates because it allows companies to offer favoritism to their own products to encourage consumers to use them, often to the detriment of competing products.

> The introduction of WatchTV and limited unlimited plans is the first true sign that we&#039;re living in a post-net neutrality world.

On Attraction. Love And Respect.,"Hello,

Love and respect are what substantially determines attraction. For every action someone does, it will eventually affect either our love or respect for them. Hence, our attraction to them will be affected as well.

 **What is respect? What is love?^^^babydonthurtme**

We all know the feelings, but mistaking feelings for one another can be common so I’ll try to clear out my definition for love and respect. Describing feelings with words is as good as describing colors with words so I figured that I’ll clear this out by giving examples.

Respect is the feeling you have when you interact or think about someone you deem powerful. People usually experience significant respect feelings for the president, the police/army, work boss, professional athletes, etc. Think about the feeling you have when you hear that a classmate has gotten a very good grade on that impossible exam that almost everyone else flunked. You’ll either envy or respect them.

Love is the feeling you have when you interact or think about someone you deem beneficial. People usually experience significant love feelings for someone who has been more good than bad to them for extended periods of time. Someone like a mother or any care provider. Think about the feeling you have when your mother couldn’t let herself sleep to take good care of you while you were sick. You’ll feel love.

**Why respect? Why love?**

Respect helps us submit to those of higher power than us. Increasing the potential of their power in exchange for security. Submission also facilitates order within groups. The deal is, “I will go by your rules, Do what you ask me to and your power will be my power”. If you respect/submit to your country’s government then their power will be yours (Education – Health – Defense, etc.) if you show disrespect and disobey the government then you’ll lose that privilege.

Love helps us bond with those of benefit to us. Taking care of their needs in exchange for the benefit they already have given to us. Which can help directly (by them returning the favor so you establish a connection of mutual benefits) or indirectly (because taking care of them just makes you feel better for example). If you love a friend you’ll provide them comfort, support, a place to stay, money, company, etc. Because they have been good to you in the past. Which will help the mutual benefit between you two grow.

**Women’s attraction is determined by respect.**

**Men’s attraction is determined by love.**

We are attracted to what we need but lack.

Respect is a function of power. If a woman respects a man, it means that she believes that he has considerable power. Which she needs but lacks.

Love is a function of benefit (benefit of sex and care taking specifically). If a man loves a woman it means that he believes that she is of considerable benefit to him. Which he needs but lacks.

**How attraction?**

As I said in the beginning of this thread. Attraction is dependent mainly on love and respect. I will discuss every possible outcome of love/respect combinations.

You either don’t love/respect someone, or you love/respect in balance or you love/respect someone too much. So there are 9 possible outcomes to this. They’re different for men and women.

First: For women.

 | Little  love| Love moderately| Love overload
---|---|----|----
**Little respect**| Better avoid him| He’s like a brother| He’s like a son
**Respect moderately**| Show interest but not much| Ideal, Show interest and compassion| Get Clingy!
**Respect overload**| He’s too good for me| He’s too good for me. I’ll suffer in silence| He’s too good for me. I’m going nuts

Second for men.

 | Little  love| Love moderately| Love overload
---|---|----|----
**Little respect**| Who’s that? Never heard of her.| She’s ok I guess| Beta orbiter. Get really annoying.
**Respect moderately**| She’s like a sister| Ideal. I need to wife her up.| Beta orbiter. Get annoying.
**Respect overload**|She’s like a mother or Angela Merkel| She’s too good or for me| Beta orbiter. Get annoying but not much

I hope this helps.

What class synergizes well with a ret pally in pvp?,"Long story short, I have a friend who is dead set on rolling a ret pally for world pvp and BG's. I get that every class can work with any other class in vanilla and blah blah.

What classes synergize well with a ret? And what weaknesses does a ret have that another class can compensate for? I want to learn a little bit about what classes would mesh well together with a ret as I know nothing about paladins (it doesn't have to be ""optimal"", this is vanilla after all, just something that would work well/be fun to try).

Thanks guys!

1000 subs in 2 months. That's pretty wholesome.,"I'm not one for the dramatic, so I guess i'll share a bit of ""history"", as much as a 2 month sub can accrue. So let's all pretend like we care about who I am and *why* the sub exists for like 2 seconds. Bear with me, i'll keep it short.

So I'm a romantic. Seems a lot of yiff trends towards the primal/animalistic nature of the characters. I'm sure a psychology major can enlighten us as to why but I studied marketing. At some point, I wondered why a community that seems to have a segment that pines for something deeper had not gone and made a subreddit dedicated to it.

Now, one day while browsing furry_irl, some nameless soul responded to a particularly cute and happy post with /r/WholesomeYiff. If you know who you are, speak now or forever hold your peace, or speak it later, your choice. Thus a foolish idea was born, then after a couple weeks a pretty good idea was born.

Ah, listen to me ramble on. Empty bottle of Tito's vodka on my desk, dozen pages of furry porn waiting to post. Shame I can't put any of this on my resume.

Flow: Create .url file in another library to link to doc,"We're on SPO, trying to provide a solution to the problem of one team wanting to save their contract documents in library A (for valid reasons), when policy states all contracts must be saved in library B.

Investigating the possibility of using a flow to:

2. Condition: tagged with XYZ
3. Action if NO: do nothing
3. Action if YES: Create .url file in library B, linking to created doc
3. Update .url file meta data to tag with XYZ



Can't figure out how to get flow to create the .url

Tried using bitly to generate the URL for the document and just use create a file, but it replicates the original file type and just creates an error.

Teenager Problem,"Hello everyone. I am currently a sophomore guy attending high school. Before I start this post, I just want to say, I just gotta empathize with a brother on parent problems. I feel as if a lot of individuals have dealt with the same/worse situation I am going through. Anyways, a lot of shit is happening with my parents. They do not love each other. My mom literally told me that she only stays with my dad for me and my brother. Anyways, today, my mom was on the phone with my dad and my dad was talking about some bullshit about going to las vegas out of no where... lol. So first of all what the fuck dad, obviously I did not say this, I would never say this to my dad, but seriously, going to vegas without telling anyone... come on man. Anyways, my dad started yelling at my mom over the phone, I cant speak korean so I have no idea what the fuck they are saying. And my dad calmed down and asked her so can I do this, I think it was for business or something idk, something beneficial and not completely out of the ordinary. And my mom, oh my god my mom, just stops talking and my dad repeats, but my mom just said do whatever you want... I just feel like my mom doesnt rationalize but attacks. Why do you have to do that man? Then, after she was done with the phone call and I asked when I could take the vocal lesson, which I asked a while ahead of time. She then says that I should focus on SAT... That absolutely infuriated me because she is acting upon her emotions again. She always makes rash decisions based on her mood and I have to suffer for it. So after I was like mom you said I could. And then she rants about how busy I am this whole week and then stops cause guess what I have nothing on sunday. So she changes her excuse of SAT to business but then she has no cards left in her hand so she has to surrender. What the actual fuck. After I asked, what time. And she straight up screams AFTER 2 YOU  KNOW THAT. Now, this is the part of the text where I want to ask for advice. A little bit about myself: One of my biggest priorities is to be a mature, gentleman. Now, a gentleman is an abstract word but how I define it is a man who is able to serve the people in his life, self control, respect, vulnerability, and the list goes on but those are the main things I can think of right now, sorry im still fucked from my encounter with my mom. Back to the story, I got mad and I said you need self control. Then she yelled I do have self control, your dad just told me that hes going to vegas, I dont know exactly what she said cause there is this language barrier between us. Then I said, you obviously dont, youre lying to yourself. Then she said this thing in korean about me being a nuisance or some shit i dont know lol. 

I fucked up man. That was not mature of me and I am disrespecting my parents. I did not demonstrate self control... It's so hard to respect parents, anyone feel me on that? Could someone give me some advice? 

To the notable individuals who read the whole context, I thank you.

A quick question regarding circuits.,"Hi, I know absolutely nothing about (Rec Rooms) circuits. I intend to make time to learn but then Rec Royale happens. 

I learned how to make real life circuits awhile back by reading books. I learned Boolean Algebra and the different number systems. I learned how to design, simplify and build a circuit with many inputs/outputs.

Are the circuits like gates? Is there math I could use to design a system using the circuits? Would my real life knowledge apply here at all? My guess is no but I am thinking maybe.

"Rey lifted more weight in TLJ than Yoda ever has, and didn't seem to need to focus at all.","Rey uses the force to [lift rocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDHXYiMh7WY) with a greater total weight than we have seen any Jedi lift in any other Star Wars film. And unlike Yoda, she doesn't have to focus or close her eyes to lift so many heavy rocks. Here's [Yoda lifting something with (likely) less total weight than Rey's rocks](https://youtu.be/rlRJLcy8NsA?t=4m12s), and he has to close his eyes to do it.

"Backpacking in Japan for 4 weeks in June 2021, rough itinerary - looking for any and all suggestions","I plan on flying from Arizona, USA to Japan with 3 other friends the whole month of June in 2021. I know it is really early to truly plan most stuff out but I just want to spend as much time as possible planning and ensuring I don't screw anything up. 

My friends and I (college sophomores going on junior year by the time we go) want to see a majority of Japan, hitting nearly every major city because this trip is once in a lifetime for us.

***Ultimately I just wanna hear back on if anything seems out of the ordinary or my numbers are off at all. I am not looking for specific recommendations of anything.***

I know this violates rule #10 but I truly just wanna hear random feedback and I don't have a strict plan yet obviously and also most things wont be planned out at all with exception to housing but,

    Day 5 : Activate JR passes and travel to Nagoya for lunch then back on route to Kyoto.
    Day 6-8 : Kyoto
    Day 9-12 : Osaka
    Day 13-15 : Kobe
    Day 15 : Travel day to Hiroshima 
    Day 16-18 : Hiroshima
    Day 19 : Flight from Hiroshima to Sapporo 
    Day 20-22 : Sapporo
    Day 23-24 : Sendai
    Day 25 : Travel day stopping in Chiba for lunch and checking out the Tokyo Bay and then traveling back to Tokyo
    Day 26-28 : End in Tokyo

**My rough budget plan per person :** 

Food -- $70 / day ($2000 total) eating mid-range meals with the occasional cheap meal and expensive meal

Housing -- $50 / day ($1400 total) mostly staying in hostels and capsules with the occasional hotel

Flights -- $1,500 \[round trip from PHX to HND or NRT\] + $300 \[flight from Hiroshima to Sapporo\] ($1800 total)

Transportation -- $700 \[21-day JR pass\] + $300 \[possible inner city transport\] ($1000 total)

Misc -- \[Random spending\] $500  + \[Basic travel insurance, Passport/VISA, SimCard\] $500 + \[Backpack gear\] $200 ($1200 total)

    Total Expenses ~ $7400 ~ Y800,000

Again, this is pretty rough and I hope it doesn't get instantly taken down but I just wanna know if anything seems out of place and if there are any expenses I am forgetting or are completely wrong about. 

I appreciate the help and would love any and all help I can get.

The new Supreme Court Ruling - How I am dealing with it,"Well, let's be real, this new ruling hurts. A a small business owner who sells a card game on shopify through Amazon FBA, i now have to pay sales tax to every state where I have customers buying my games. This is my worst nightmare coming true, and up until now I was solely remitting taxes to the state where I physically work out of. However now I need to file with every other state (this is expensive) AND start mailing in withheld sales tax to them. This is an unbelievable reporting burden so I am probably going to bite the bullet and just use Tax Jar: [https://taxjar.grsm.io/dkrf](https://taxjar.grsm.io/dkrf). I was never planning on using this service, but now with this bull shit it literally seems like i have no choice.

Why are some low paying or low skill jobs so particular in the workers they hire?,"I am not trying to put down anyone or any job. I’m asking more in terms of what the company gets out of being so particular. If the job isn’t technical, requiring a specific information or skill set, or requiring things like a specific degree, why be so particular? 

It costs time and money to interview and re interview candidates. I’m guessing the company loses a certain amount of revenue from not having a position open for a longer period of time. 

I’m talking about job positions like a cashier at a bakery shop requiring 3 interviews. Or a sweeper/maintenance man at an auto repair shop requiring multiple interviews. 

I agree that companies should be looking for workers with past experience at that job. If you’ve already done it before, there’s less training to do at your new place you’re working at.

But by having such a long hiring process, is there really that much of a difference in quality of workers? Like is one sweeper or clean up person that much better than the rest?",1,2018-06-22 05:38:00,jobs,cicibellis4life,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8sykel/why_are_some_low_paying_or_low_skill_jobs_so/,/r/jobs/comments/8sykel/why_are_some_low_paying_or_low_skill_jobs_so/,8sykel,CB[deleted],CA[deleted],CS[deleted],2018-06-21 21:39:41.209542

I’m tired of this,"   I’m tired of feeling sad all of the time, waking up with negative thoughts. Sometimes these thoughts make me want to cry, no matter where I am or what I’m doing. I’ve had to fight it off when I’m working, or out around other people, but mostly all I do is stay in bed and cry. I rarely go out, some days I don’t get out of bed if I don’t have to at all. Doing the smallest things seems impossible, even reaching over to get a glass of water on my nightstand is too much. I try to tell myself to snap out of it, try to replace the bad thoughts with good ones, but it only works for a while. I try to fake being happy while I’m around other people, so nobody will ask me what’s wrong, or tell me to “get over it”. I stay quiet, l laugh and get along with everyone, but inside I just want to be alone. I feel like I don’t belong, that I don’t fit in around other people because this sadness won’t go away. I begin to wonder if I’m a bad person, that I don’t deserve to be happy or to be cared for.

Hannah Gadspy's special Nanette,"Tonight I watched Hannah Gadsby's special on Netflix and I'm overcome.

I bring it here to this subreddit because it is a raw, funny, breathtakingly profound and moving anthem for those of us on the broken side of the Island of Misfit Toys. 

The only thing I have ever seen that is even remotely close is Tig Notaro's stuff, and even that feels like absolute amateur hour after watching this.

If you relate to #MeToo this will likely leave you in a puddle (from which you will emerge stronger and empowered and grateful.

If you are critical or suspicious of #MeToo I hope you will take 1 hour and 9 minutes to try to understand it from the heart of it. If you are going to use #MeToo as a punchline or a SJW slur or whatever, please, watch this and understand that THIS is what #MeToo is really about. 

I've been trying to write about #MeToo in a way that would explain it to those who are ambivalent about or annoyed by it. I fully understand how it is being twisted and manipulated. I do. I hear you when you're frustrated. I do. But please  give me an hour and see if you can at least understand why it moves us. 

And here's the thing: she never once says ""MeToo."" Not once. It's not about that movement. But it would also apply just as much to #BlackLivesMatter, #ItGetsBetter, whatever. 

I'm not bringing this here because of Chris. This isn't about what he did or didn't do or who was crazier or who is remember what wrong or any of that shit, and this isn't the thread to discuss it.

But as someone who was once moved by Chris's work, I have to say that while his was popcorn and fun and giggles and hugs, this is real and raw and vulnerable and pulls no punches and is a story that I believe will change me fundamentally in a way that that book doesn't even compare to. 

I recommend it, and would love to talk to others that connect with it.

Need Help With Gear Recommendations for Backcountry,"Hello Redditers,

Need of some advice for **backcountry** hiking for a somewhat first timer.

I’ll be planning a one-night backcountry hike through Algonquin Park this summer with some friends. 

However, I’ll be later doing solo backcountry hiking as well and this is what I need to prepare for in the end, I also want to do backcountry hiking in Patagonia and camping around Iceland via bicycle (if possible).

A few recommendations that I’m looking for are one-person tents ($200 budget), water-purifications methods other than boiling or expensive filtration systems (if possible), portable cooking equipment, safe food handling (prevent unwanted feeding of animals), backpack good for hiking and DSLR camera. I don’t need a GPS at this time but do any of you use one? I have clothing, shoes, sleeping bag, pocketknife, and some food options covered. Anything else I missed.

A bit about myself, I’ve done day hikes in Peru, overnight hike in the Sumatran rainforest, drove around Iceland in a camper van, neither of which I did solo. As I mentioned, I need to prepare for solo backcountry and camping in various places with different climates. Your help and suggestions are appreciated.",1,2018-06-22 05:37:56,CampingandHiking,416wingman,https://www.reddit.com/r/CampingandHiking/comments/8sykdz/need_help_with_gear_recommendations_for/,/r/CampingandHiking/comments/8sykdz/need_help_with_gear_recommendations_for/,8sykdz,CB[deleted],CA[deleted],CS[deleted],2018-06-21 21:39:46.759615

Making friends in your 20s,"Background:
I'm in my 20s. Just graduated from college last year and currently in a new job na medyo hectic.
Have nothing but weekends (and the occasional holidays) for rest.

It's starting to get lonely for me. You'll know you're lonely when you're a nerdy introvert and you're seeking out new friends. Pero I can't seem to meet people I can get along with, i.e. people my age range with the same interests and disposition as mine.

I'm thinking weekends are the only time I have to meet new people. Pero I don't know where to start or which places to go.

Anyways, I'm looking for people who are creative (artsy and/or musical, a bit on the hipster/indie side), fascinated about knowledge (people with whom you can discuss books, ideas, and Vsauce/Veritasium videos), and all sorts of related stuff.

Any suggestions how and where to meet a community like this, preferably in Central Luzon or Metro Manila?
Any suggestions on how to make friends in general?

Really looking forward to your comments, seriously.

Enjoy Your Rabbit vinyl fortunes?,"I know they offered fortune cookies at certain record stores upon the release of EYR on vinyl with any purchase of the record, and I saw one user on /r/vinyl posted years back that she/he received a fortune in her colored vinyl. Did all colored copies of the vinyl come with a fortune or was she/he just ‘fortunate’? 

Also if you received one of the fortunes Sufjan wrote, whether it be from a record store or in a vinyl, would you be interested in sharing it here?


The only ones I could find online are:

1. “Amazing shit about to go down. Lucky Number: 27”

2. “Will you marry me? Lucky number: 0110111001101111” *

3. “You are going to die. Deal with it.”

4. “Just get a liberal arts degree. Figure it out later.”

5. “Come over here and kiss me all over.”

6. “Time for plan B.”

*The lucky number in #2 is binary for ‘no’. 


And I am unsure if this was EYR related but Sufjan posted this fortune years back on Tumblr:

**Evasive Maneuver**

Once per game. Once you hide in a locker for at least 5, 4, 3 seconds, you set up for a quick escape. If the killer searchers the locker that you are in you perform a combat roll avoiding getting caught and stunning the killer for 2 seconds.

**Get Down**

When standing still, get a button to press to lay on the ground, you crawl 30%, 20%, 10% slower then the dying state but your noises are reduced by 30%, 40%, 50%.

What Evidence Would You Allow to Change Your Mind and Renounce Anarcho-Capitalism?,"Forgive any errors, I'm using a speech-to-text program and I won't catch all of it's fantastical fuck ups.

I've been asking this around different communities in Reddit, starting with Communism, and then Libertarianism. I decided to move to anarcho-capitalism as I've had some debates with anarcho-capitalists that have disenchanted me from the ideology.

The question is as the title States: what evidence would you allowed to change your mind and renounce anarcho-capitalism? I think this is important for everybody to think about, is oftentimes what I find in people is a lack of willingness to consider that they might be wrong and that the evidence might actually be out there. No one is perfect, and I've constantly found that there is always information that I didn't know about that was so vital that it completely changed the way I thought about the world.

If the answer is ""there is nothing that would change my mind on the subject."" And believe me I have seen this answer before, then I would ask that you reflect on why that is, and consider the possibility of you being wrong.

In order to be Fair I'll answer this question myself first; I'm a minarchist, I believe that the state should be as small as possible, and that taxes should be voluntary. In order for me to change my mind on this subject, I would need to see that people people are incapable of regulating a state system. This might look like complete apathy from oppression in a free Society. Before anybody jumps up and says that the US is an example of this, I would like to point out that things are changing. Trump was elected, and the populace is becoming more open with each year. Many states are legalizing marijuana, and although other drugs may take a little bit longer to legalize, it will happen eventually. Obviously there are other things that might change my mind, but I don't want to list all of them because I could write a book on all the possible failings of my own ideology.

As a quick side note, I decided to post this here because I've had a few anarcho-capitalists who I've debated with telling me that all the ""real' anarcho-capitalists are here. But I eventually plan on posting this on r/anarchocapitalism.",1,2018-06-22 05:37:47,u_GingerJack76,GingerJack76,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_GingerJack76/comments/8sykd2/what_evidence_would_you_allow_to_change_your_mind/,/r/u_GingerJack76/comments/8sykd2/what_evidence_would_you_allow_to_change_your_mind/,8sykd2,CB[deleted],CA[deleted],CS[deleted],2018-06-21 21:39:54.765613

New extraction equipment best I have ever seen for commercial production.,"New start up has developed fully automated extractor (patented and patent pending). No, it is not cheap, but these guys are legit, flew me out to see it, paid all expenses and it is everything they said it was. Designers have 30 years of experience designing and installing extraction and lp gas systems worldwide. If you are legally permitted to produce and need to process 300 lbs of plant material/week (5 days) , quickly and efficiently, this machine can do it and **with** **ONE PERSON**. Single operator. No adjustments during process. Simply load. Push start. Auto shut down. Unload. Reload. Cap. 20 lbs per run. Process is 2.5 hours/batch. When batch complete, notification is sent to iPhone/mobile device. Full reports logged per run. Formula/recipe fully adjustable on all variables. Prototype machine has been in use in Colorado for last 18 months with one operator and never gone down. It is closed system butane, so if you are opposed to extracting using that solvent, this isn't for you. However, this is the fastest, safest, most cost effective and reliable system I have ever seen. And it is the only fully automated one on the market I know of. I am the west coast sales rep and cover WA, CA OR and NV. If you want to learn more pm me.

Setting my distance preference to “Anywhere” has been going waaaaay better than I expected.,"Throughout my life, I have had horrible luck in finding people who I really connect with on both a superficial and deep level. I guess it’s because I have a somewhat unique personality and set of beliefs. I’m an attractive guy, so it’s not like it would be incredibly hard for me to find meaningless sex, but that’s not for me.

After years of bad luck on Tinder & Bumble, I decided to give OKC another go even though I remembered that it reeeaally sucks in my city (and surrounding areas).

I changed the distance settings on OKC to “Anywhere” because I was annoyed and was experimenting. Within minutes I found girls who seem to be a better fit for me than any of the girls I’ve dated in the past (and I’ve dated a considerable number of girls). They’re all 500+ miles away at the moment, but screw it. I’ll do the long-distance thing if it means I finally get to have a meaningful relationship. 

I encourage you to try it. Sometimes you gotta be patient to find someone who’s really good for you. Wish me luck!

Tl;dr If you have a unique personality, set the distance to “anywhere” and see who you can find. There are worse things than relationships that start out long-distance.",4,2018-06-22 05:37:43,OkCupid,justincredible122,https://www.reddit.com/r/OkCupid/comments/8sykck/setting_my_distance_preference_to_anywhere_has/,/r/OkCupid/comments/8sykck/setting_my_distance_preference_to_anywhere_has/,8sykck,CB[deleted],CA[deleted],CS[deleted],2018-06-21 21:39:57.796492

SHG - CODWW2 is absolute sh!t! (PC) Lobby caters to whomever has the worst connection!,"It had potential, But Condrey f\*cked that all up and I was soo glad to see him gone. I really hoped for a turnaround. Very little got better. The same old garbage Netcode from Demonware, Horrible game play with the divisions and perk system, SHG and Activisions complete disregard to implement any type of anti-hack but instead rely on what little community is left to report shit to a Twitter account. So what is the point of your ingame reporting??  My stupidity was paying for the Full DLC pack before the game came out.  So now I have all these f\*cking maps that I can't play as the lobbies are so empty on PC (Cause Sh!t game that everyone is tired of waiting for SHG to fix) and the players that are there don't have the DLC packs so I can't get into the damn maps!! Next time I'll just buy a couple bags of manure as it seems to have more value then this game!  
The last straw was figuring out that the game now caters to those with the worst connection in the lobby. I wondered about  how the gameplay fared to those with a worse connection, so I tested this my throttling my down/up connection speed. Any decent router can do this through QOS settings by limiting you up/down pipeline.  This is usually done to help alleviate bufferbloat for inconsistent connections. My fiber connection yields me 1 Gbps down/50 Mbps up. I reserve 200 Mbps for personal and the rest is for work. For gaming I had 50Mbps reserved leaving 150 Mbps for the rest of the household (Streaming, etc). At 50 Mbps I usually had a somewhat decent gameplay. In game ""Pingbars"" were all green about 80&#37; of the time. Later on at night they went yellow some as I started to get thrown into overseas lobbies thanks to Deamonware lobby routing. I removed the 50 Mbps cap and reserved the whole 200 Mbps for gaming and now all of the games I go into I'm yellow ""Pingbars"" and the game play is shit. Guys will Red ""Pingbars"" are dominating the lobbies.  So last test I pulled some more bandwidth and went a full 500 Mbps connection and now I'm hitting red ""Pingbars"" in game.  So obviously the faster your connection the shittier your gameplay will be. No point in throwing the full 1 Gbps connection if I'm already seeing this shit at 500 Mbps.  


If you don't play this on PC then you have nothing really to add to this discussion;   
If your parents pay for your internet, Then there is nothing for you to see here;  
If you had to Google QOS then just click next topic;

If you don't know how to access your router or the basics of NetSec (you probably had to Google that also), This is not the topic your looking for.

Curious how long it will take the Mods/Admin to lock/block this topic like they have with all of the rest of mine showing solid proof how bad the Netcode really is.",0,2018-06-22 05:37:42,WWII,_GonzoInc,https://www.reddit.com/r/WWII/comments/8sykce/shg_codww2_is_absolute_sht_pc_lobby_caters_to/,/r/WWII/comments/8sykce/shg_codww2_is_absolute_sht_pc_lobby_caters_to/,8sykce,CB[deleted],CA[deleted],CS[deleted],2018-06-21 21:39:58.464110

A4A Hookers and Whores," I'm Claudia and I'm into lots of different types of roleplay, but tonight I'm looking to focus on prostitution, pimping, whoring, or gold digging! (Feel free to check out a few of my other posts if you like) I can play male or female, and I can sub or dom. My main thing for tonight is that there's sex being ""bought."" Here are a few examples:

A girl who's using cragslist to sell sex for some extra cash.

A boyfriend gets his girl to fuck a few guys to make a few bucks.

A white trash trailer girl who started whoring herself out since she got fired.

Starbucks has a new service where customers can pay to have fun with the baristas.

A world where it's common for girls to go to whore school instead of college

Anything where a person gives money and gets sex! Please feel free to come with your own ideas, from realistic roles to full alternate universes!

If this post turns you on or got a cool idea in your head go ahead and find me @emperoress\_claudia and tell me your favorite sex position, and whether you like blondes, brunettes, or redheads! Don't be a nub who leaves one sentence expects a response!

Oh, and feel free to check out some of my other [r/Roleplaykik](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplaykik) posts and see if any of them sound fun to you.

"Flores Ranaka Robusta - Full City+, 9:22","[Link.](https://imgur.com/a/ubAYaye)

Notes:

Smaller 4 oz charge required additional agitation initially with wooden spoon. I wanted to roast a smaller batch because I didn’t know what I was getting myself into :)

Took this to 443f, right to the edge of a rolling 2C.

Initially smell after cooling was faint rubber, like a bicycle tire. Wife commented it smelled like plastic.

After sitting for a while, the weird smell gave way to a thick dark chocolate and nutty aroma.

Cupped at 1:12, 10 min. Initial impressions: Really hits the back of the palate. Bittersweet, like a rush of baking chocolate finishing with almonds. Strong, fat, full flavor, almost overwhelming at first, but tapers into bittersweet chocolate.

I think... I like this... a lot. It’s just so strikingly different from the Arabica I’m used to. If Arabica is the daylight of coffee, this is the dank, dark night. Caffeine-wise, this is far too punchy to use on its own in a pour over. I don’t want tachycardia and jitters. 

My experience with this is totally inconsistent with the Robusta anti-hype. Apart from a faint initial weird smell, there’s no gasoline taste, no burnt rubber, nothing off-putting. I can understand not liking it, because it is intense. But I like this one.

I have a little light-roasted Ethiopia Kochere left. Pretty good, but blending this Robusta in will give it the thick body and  full flavor I crave.

"When calorie counts are listed by volume or weight, is that pre- or post-cooking?","For example, one cup of dry rice becomes roughly two cups of cooked rice, thanks to the absorption of water. The water obviously adds no calories so if the package says “one cup” of rice is 200 calories, is that one cup of uncooked rice (meaning two cups of cooked rice), or one cup of cooked rice (meaning half a cup of uncooked rice)?

Same goes for calorie counts listed by weight: for example, cooking pasta adds considerable weight from water. Would the calorie count refer to the weight of the dry pasta, or the weight of the heavier cooked pasta?",1,2018-06-22 05:37:33,NoStupidQuestions,Nerrolken,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/8sykb9/when_calorie_counts_are_listed_by_volume_or/,/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/8sykb9/when_calorie_counts_are_listed_by_volume_or/,8sykb9,CB[deleted],CA[deleted],CS[deleted],2018-06-21 21:40:13.176698
Why are Valve's Steam Summer Sale tie-in mini-games so bad?,"I am reposting this, since the title I picked last time was pretty misleading.

Valve Software is one of the best game developers out there. When it comes to the web games they create as a tie-in with their Summer Sale though - they produce some seriously sub-par content. How can it be?

Do they give the job to interns? Perhaps let their employees' kids try luck at game design? If so - that would actually be something really cool.

If not - then I am just baffled by the low production level of art assets and gameplay design. Am I missing something here?

(This is not a ""hate post"". I am honestly trying to understand why these games, posters, collectible sticker packs from previous sales - are all continuously at such sub-par level at the company with seemingly bottomless pockets and talent pool).",2,2018-06-22 05:37:32,NoStupidQuestions,QubaHQ,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/8sykb8/why_are_valves_steam_summer_sale_tiein_minigames/,/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/8sykb8/why_are_valves_steam_summer_sale_tiein_minigames/,8sykb8,CB[deleted],CA[deleted],CS[deleted],2018-06-21 21:40:14.328681

Navigating weight hyperawareness in young girls...,"My family has outrageously unhealthy views about weight. I’ve been listening to every woman in my family call themselves fat, disgusting, unworthy of being photographed for my entire life. Being told to “suck it in” or “eat a cheeseburger” from these same women for as long as I can remember. Genuinely wonderful people just... absolutely toxic relationship with weight. This is just background info so you see where I’m coming from. 

I now live far away so I don’t have to think about it much anymore. I’m also pretty fit and short, just a generally small person. I’m not around adolescent girls much but I have 2 nieces (husband’s family) who are 10 and 6. Their dad is like 6’4 and built like a linebacker. The 10 year old is already taller than me! She simply has a larger frame, she is not overweight by any stretch of the imagination. 

I’m in town for a short while and we’ve been swimming basically the whole time and I seem to make her uncomfortable. She keeps making comments referring to weight and I just don’t even know what to say! I just want her to feel like weight literally doesn’t fucking matter and it’s the least important thing about her but I don’t know how to express that? I haven’t been responding to any of her comments, just kind of silently let the moments pass. I feel like if I were to say “weight is irrelevant, you’re beautiful, capable, wonderful!” she’d just roll her eyes and say she knows... but does she? I want her to FEEL that way. What sorts of things should I be saying and doing to decrease her awareness of weight in general? 

Im pretty athletic and so is she so I’m already taking every opportunity to show her that what matters is what our bodies can *do* and not what they look like. It just... doesn’t feel like that’s enough. I’m going to be leaving soon and I’m just wondering if there’s anything kinda casual I can say as a compliment or as encouragement.

Pretty much my observations are that the soil levels seem absurdly high and in instances where these churches have been restored significant amounts of soil have to be removed. And even then it appears that the buildings may extend even deeper. the [windows](https://i.imgur.com/lUBdSPi.jpg) are [far to low to the ground](https://i.imgur.com/4yygxyK.jpg) inviting banditry and requiring metal grates. often we see strange [metal wiring](https://i.imgur.com/rosMC8k.jpg) going throughout ([to thin to be structural](https://imgur.com/a/UKqYz)) the church and connecting to the [faraday cage](https://i.imgur.com/eaHW6qK.jpg) like onion domes. Also the amount of red brick used in the construction of these churches is staggering. Often times these buildings will have walls a [meter](https://i.imgur.com/dL3aeSL.jpg) or more thick.

https://i.imgur.com/RaafOft.jpg

https://i.imgur.com/Oxs6c2B.jpg

 Many of these structures were finally abandoned only in the early twentieth century when Bolshevik hordes removed the clergy and ransacked the temples. My observations include not only an anomalous rise in the soil level but a complete lack of fireplaces or chimneys in any of these buildings

. [Originally it seems these churches had cast iron flooring that was highly resistant to rust. ](https://xp.reddit.com/r/CulturalLayer/comments/7xttt9/castiron_flooring_in_ancient_temples/?st=JIIAOAIS&sh=842270ac)

These cathedrals are certainly not the only place we observe this anomalous accumulation of soil. The sub r /culturallayer is first and foremost a place to document this phenomenon.

r/Culturallayer what does it entail? If you are new to the subject I feel obligated to break it down for you. 
The name of the sub Reddit is tongue and cheek because this is the phrase that our lazy historians have given to any build up of soil that lacks a formal explanation; no mater where the site may be, or how high the soil is or what is found beneath. This name ""cultural layer"" is absurd for a variety of reasons. Most notably because dust and dirt will not accumulate 2-15 meters and sometimes more in the time frame that we are given simply because the locals forgot or were unable or un-willing to sweep their streets. 

Another fact that spits in the face of historians is the complete lack of any and all cultural items in this layer. Would people not have dropped things along the way if this layer truly consists of rubbish that was never cleaned?

It's with this satirical approach to the official narrative that I view all aspects of history and I encourage everyone to do the same from [fake chronology](https://xp.reddit.com/r/CulturalLayer/comments/7u0w1m/a_synopsis_of_phantom_time_theory_in_my_own_words/), [fake historical figures](https://xp.reddit.com/r/CulturalLayer/comments/87c6d3/nik_research_our_stolen_history_rasputin_and_the/) to [falsified artifacts](https://xp.reddit.com/r/CulturalLayer/comments/85oc72/change_my_view_the_floral_wreath_found_in_king/)  please share all your discoveries here!

MatchMaking by card Levek,"In my opinion you should do the MatchMaking by level of cards, one of the reasons is that even though they match you with People of your ""level"", most of the times they have cards with 3 levels or 2 higher than you, and its a total disadvantage, if you did it by level of cards, i dont think it is a such a disadvantage, because there you can see Who is good and who's not, but if it is by level of the King's tower you dont kill many of him troops because they beat you in level or failing to remove the levels of cards and that is as in tournament rules, it would be the most fair based on other competitive games, in LoL, in CS:GO and fortnite only depends on your hability and do dont depend at All that both the level of your cards or weapons, basically because there is no, and matches you with People of your hability, basically tournament rules, its Just a suggestion, thank for reading everything ",1,2018-06-22 05:37:23,ClashRoyale,MitiuKrat,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClashRoyale/comments/8syk9z/matchmaking_by_card_levek/,/r/ClashRoyale/comments/8syk9z/matchmaking_by_card_levek/,8syk9z,Sorry for my English ,CA[deleted],1,2018-06-21 21:40:57.781228

She had to be moved to an assisted living facility, so now it has been unkempt for about 6 months. The house is up against an area of woods that is an eagle reserve, everytime we go out there it's so serene with nature sounds.

Please help me identify most of the plants and how to care for them, I just realized last week that I need to actually water them lol......

The only emotions I am capable of are hate, rage and fear. Misanthropic hatred for humanity, impotent rage, and fear of other men. Very strong feelings of androphobia.

I feel like i'm suffocating in hate and rage. I experience it daily. I don't know what to do. When other people (men) insult, accost and are violent towards me, I cannot defend myself even though I want to. I freeze up. I am not strong or tall. Defending myself would be like hitting someone with a feather. That's the way it feels in my mind anyway. I feel like I can't have any affect on them. So, I just take it like I have always done form every man (Especially my father) since I was little. I just bottle up all the hate and rage and live in fear.

My father is VERY conservative, VERY religious, and VERY violent. He would constantly emasculate me. I was never masculine or christian enough for him.

How good is it to really see him flowing in the one dayers? Shaun Marsh is probably one of the most misunderstood Australians. A big chunk of that is the only red ball cricket for him stigma. I don't even know how my boi isn't playing all those IPL matches. 

It's wonderful to see his strokemaking unrestricted.

"29 [m4f] - Nothing Crazy, Just a Nice Guy Looking For a Chat Pal","Right off the bat, I'm looking for a casual chat type thing.  But also one that can be naughty.  A pretty simple request, but still a lot of fun.  I'm really not much of a roleplayer, but I think that's because I would much rather just be me, than some fictional character.  But still...

I'm 5'9, 220 lbs, brown hair, brown eyes.  I wear a shirt and tie to work, but am a jeans and t-shirt kinda guy on the weekends.  I own six pairs of Chuck Taylors, so whatever that means.  I manage a telecommunications center, which really isn't as terrible as it sounds.  It give me ample time to fuck around on the Internet.  I'm also working on a masters degree is business administration.  It really takes up a good deal of my time, but when I am free, I'm a bit of a homebody.  I like to explore and stuff, but I'm equally happy staying home and relaxing.  I read a bit everyday, normally bouncing between a fantasy or dystopian novel or comics books, but I throw a biography in there once in a while.  I like playing video games, but don't play as much as I used to.  

On the dirtier side of things, my tastes are pretty eclectic.  Experiences have been pretty vanilla for the most part, and that's not necessarily a bad thing.  I don't really have a ""type"", and am pretty open to new things.  I do absolutely love eating pussy.  Like, a lot.  I like getting blowjobs too, but who doesn't.  Sometimes I'm in more of a submissive mood; sometimes more dominant, so I guess we can say I'm a switch.  Either way, outside of the extreme weird things like children and animals and tentacles and mutilation; I'm pretty open.

*SO*, if you'd like to chat a bit, here I am, and I look forward to hearing from you!",1,2018-06-22 05:37:10,dirtykikpals,GrilledCheeseForAll,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtykikpals/comments/8syk7t/29_m4f_nothing_crazy_just_a_nice_guy_looking_for/,/r/dirtykikpals/comments/8syk7t/29_m4f_nothing_crazy_just_a_nice_guy_looking_for/,8syk7t,CB[deleted],CA[deleted],CS[deleted],2018-06-21 21:41:56.781722

Counter Play and Play Style Analysis,"BEWARE , Potentially Long post ahead
Lets analyse the new counterplay and playstyle thread because personally i feel that the game we play and the game epic is trying to portray may be completely different games.



1) **Important to support a variety of late game strategies, that don’t boil down to “just build lol""**
 Completely Agreed , it is not a good thing that new players will have to force about 100hours before they win their first game , and the only way they can do that is by building and the response they get when asking for help is to 'just build'. It is indeed not a great thing and to change the meta so that building is not the only method lets take a look at the steps epic takes.
Keep in mind , steps that should be taken should be to portray and push that building is NOT the only way , building as a whole should not be greatly tampered with or change to allow for other methods to overtake it.
Before that lets address other issues epic feels the game has ,



2) **superiority of shotguns, rockets in smaller circles**
The battlefield gets smaller as the game progresses , micromanaging your loadout should be the name of the game. As the game gets smaller it should be expected of any player who wants to win and uses even the tiniest bit of logical sense that they should get more explosives and ditch items like sniper rifles. Saying that you do not want shotguns and rocket launchers to dominate in smaller circle fights is like saying you do not want snipers and rifles to work in medium to long range fights. Similarly to how we see everyone using rifles and snipers in medium to long range when we get face to face with each other 20-50 metres apart expect players to use rockets and shotguns as it only makes sense.



3) **uncapped building are such a dominant play style**
This needs further elaboration as right now in smaller circles we are obviously limited to building within the circle itself as well as the height limit. And we also have a material cap at 999. and unlike weapons we cannot drag in materials into the circle by constantly swapping it with an item we already have. 



4) **other strategies are being drowned out**
I completely disagree and i will explain in the coming points.



5)** give you options to counter other players in combat, especially in the late game**
This is important. Because we already have so many options in combat. Players should carry C4 or grenades perhaps maybe a rocket launcher to counter opponents who are building. By limiting the number of rockets to stop rocket spam and quick swapping you are also stopping players from countering those who are building quickly. Limiting rockets to stop rocket spam is like limiting the shotgun shells one can carry to stop the double shotgun combo. It just wouldnt work. And punishing the players who have already spent alot on the game and the hours spent learning to build for something that is not even a new player's fault but due to the lack of counters that was taken away through your limitation on explosives , is no one else's but yours. 12 rockets is definitely too little. Its only 3 clips on a grenade launcher including the one that is already loaded in.



6) **exploring changes to weapon balance** 
This is always a welcome change as long as it is done it a shooting test before hand like it was done previously.



7) **resource economy, like e.g. resource caps.**
This is a huge factor that nobody likes. The only readily available resource is wood. Many people always have a cap of 999 wood at the end of the game. Not so much brick and metal. Doing this will ruin the material economy in many ways - vending machines become useless , people already dont use vending machines even if it has a legendary item that they want unless they have an excess of materials or they are in desperation. Already after the resource nerf , we are being forced to mine for much longer periods for a short fight. With this cap nerf you might as well vault vending machines and the lot. And if we get spammed by a minigun or lmg we should just leave if we hear the sound because its either we take the damage face on or we waste all our materials acting like they would run out of bullets before we do materials. even right now it takes close to 500 mats to fully block someone with max small bullets with a minigun.

Conclusion 
**So, where does this leave us?**
There ARE multiple strategies. C4 and grenades are excellent. The new smoke grenades even without destroying structures force players out into the open.
If it ends up in a build off its not because there were no other options , its because the last few players WANT it to be a build off.
Thanks for reading.

Turning cotton wool into artificial silk: the synthesis of rayon fibers,,9004,2018-07-01 18:15:24,chemicalreactiongifs,crnaruka,https://i.imgur.com/TfpsgJc.gifv,/r/chemicalreactiongifs/comments/8vbe15/turning_cotton_wool_into_artificial_silk_the/,8vbe15,"**Explanation:**
---

The video captions do a good job of walking you through the main steps, but here is a bit more detail. The reaction proceeds as follows:

1. First copper (II) carbonate hydroxide reactions with ammonia in order to create tetraaminecopper(II) hydroxide through the following reaction: CuCO*_3_*.Cu(OH)*_2_*.H*_2_*O(s) + 4NH*_3_*(aq) → CuCO*_3_*(s) + [Cu(NH3)*_4_*]^(2+)(aq) + 2OH^(–)(aq) + H*_2_*O(l)

2. Cotton wool is then added to the solution and the cellulose reactions with the copper complex through the reaction [shown here](https://i.imgur.com/dkzIAFn.png). As a result of this complexation the cellulose now becomes soluble. This mixture is called viscose.

3. The viscose solution is then injected into a solution of sulfuric acid. At this pH the copper complex is stripped away and cellulose precipitates again into long fibers. Initially the fibers are blue because of some leftover copper salts, but those soon diffuse away, leaving behind silky clear fibers.

TIFU by buying a house that wasn’t attached to the sewer and discovering this fact while crawling through my own plops [NSFW],"Obligatory this was a while ago.

So it's a known fact amongst friends and family that I always have a poop or fart joke waiting to go. It's just who I am. You can have your turgid penis and voluptuous vagina jokes, I'll take a heaving helping of poop jokes with a squelching mound of fart stories any day of the week. If you've shat your pants in public I want to know, the more public and embarrassing the better, it's not a sex thing I swear; I've just always been like that since I was a young child. There is something inherently humorous to a subject so personal and private and that will never change. 

That knowledge combined with the events I am about to relay to you make me wonder if perhaps we do live in a world where unseen forces act to maximize the comedic value of my life.

Some don't believe me when I tell them this tale but there's a link at the end with video evidence so suspend your disbelief and prepare to be grateful for your moderate home repair issues, it could be far worse.
Here we go.

My wife and I bought the house with a few minor problems that were handled during closing like all deals are, we knew there would be a few surprises from what friends and family said so we stashed some money aside and opened a Home Depot card for the promotional no interest purchases. 

Sure enough the floor wasn't insulted in the downstairs and since the crawlspace was hard to get around in to the inspector never caught it. I went ahead and purchased a load of insulation to re-insulate, whatever. It was summer and after getting married a few months earlier then moving we were exhausted so we worked on the interior of the house and the yard for the remainder of the good weather.

During this time we'd get the occasional whiff of something stanky but didn't think much of it. I'd buy some Draino and the smell would go away. Ok, the house has some plumbing issues, no biggie, $7 a week until we got the rest of the home under control and we'd get a plumber in to take look.
It's the week before Thanksgiving and I finally get under the house to work on that insulation. It's cooler and everything is drying out for the winter. 

I've been in some crawl spaces that would gross the average human out before but this place, Jesus fucking Christ this place took the cake, blew a load all over it, force-fed it to a drugged out former child actor then bottled the shit they produced for resale at the local farmer's market as a skin care product it was so evil. I knew right then we were in for a ride, the house had been flipped and if it wasn't visible during a tour it had not been fixed.

That week I found 2 dead cats, an old stereo system from the 80s that had been hulk smashed, a car wheel, a broken window for a bar from New Hampshire (we're in New York) and so much insulation it took fifteen extra large trash bags to remove among other random debris. Even with a respirator my nose still get clogged and I spend the remainder of the day with no sense of smell.

Anyone who knows anything about homes will tell you when someone flips a house they tend to buy shitholes and plug them with some spackel to keep the streams of festering shit at bay before selling them to unsuspecting dupes like us. 

If you're buying a home that's been flipped negotiate like you're fucking the shit out of a fresh coconut that will be thrown away immediately like any normal person would because I guarantee you that those sellers have been hiding cum filled coconuts in the walls just waiting for you to find as you settle in and attempt to make changes to the home. They don't give a fuck if the place falls apart next year because the reality of real estate law is it's buyer beware. They deserve to make as little as fucking possible for their ""trouble"" so go in fucking if you want to come out satisfied. Then again I'm biased as you will come to find out.

So I'm under the house two days before Thanksgiving and hauling bags of old insulation out through a tiny hole I can barely fit through. My wife tells me she's going to take a shower and won't be able to help if I need anything. I crawl back under and figure I'll grab another bag or two and call it quits.

Then I hear the water. If you're a homeowner the worst sound you can hear is water running where it shouldn't be. That's better than never hearing the water but it still means there's a lot of water where it shouldn't be any and if you don't find it things get messy fast.I didn't know much but I knew that.

I hear a splattering that is roughly equivalent of a shower running but it sounds like water is pouring into a pool. I've owned a home for less than 4 months at this point so everything makes me nervous but this struck fear in my heart. It's even coming from the corner of the crawlspace the inspector couldn't get to because of ductwork making this urgent andsuper inconvenient.

I'm about 100 pounds lighter than the inspector so I squirm my way over the main sewer line and over the field of nasty old insulation that would still take another ten bags to remove. Clouds of fiberglass cat piss dust are billowing and making it hard to see through my respirator. I wriggle under the main return air duct just barely making, something shifts and the fucker slides about 3 inches closer to the ground making a return from this side of the crawlsapce impossible. I sigh and keep going. My nose is always clogged from the moment I get down there, something about that dust just immediately makes it impossible for me to smell anything for a good couple of hours even though I make sure the respirator fits snugly against my face.

The light of my headlamp illuminates the problem, there's a stream of water pouring from somewhere between the joists. I think to myself ""Great! The pipe broke?!"" and crawl forward to the sparkling stream. I climb over a mound and down the other side onto what I thought was dirt but the moment I touched it the layer of dirt on the water rippled with the water beneath it. I see the brown ripples spreading but it's too late and the cool water floods into my gloves, moments later I realize my entire torso is wet as the water soaks through my jumpsuit. ""What the fuck!?"" this is more than a single shower. This is, like a month of showers in a dusty lake under our house. The water stops running and I decide it's time to just get out of the crawlspace and call the plumber. We put away money specifically for stuff like this, it won't be fun but whatever.

I'm moister than an oyster at this point and take a soggy second to look over the tangle of pipes and mountains of dirt - weird the floor should be flat but whatever - searching for a path to where there's a space behind the furnace I'll be able to slide through. I see it and start slogging through the sludgy mud trying to figure out what it's going to cost to drain this water so the plumber can work. 

The I hear it. A toilet flush. It didn't hit me until it hit me, the better part of a flush splattered across my back unleashing a sub-human scream of disgust and outrage. I turned back to try to see where it's coming from and respirator caught on a random old pipe sticking out of the ground sliding to the side. 

A whiff of unadulterated corruption made it to my clogged crawlspace dust filled sinuses. Jesus, Buddha, Sagan, anyone with temporal admin rights wind this horror story back and get me out of here. Send me back to the womb, let me start over, I want to start over; we have to go back, Kate!
I'm sure you're thinking ""Why the fuck would my wife shit after showering?"" I thought same thing, to be honest I don't know, she married me; I livestream jars of meat for my own personal entertainment, I guess she's going to be a little off, too.

The realization of how far up shit's creek I am soaked into my brain at the same speed of that which soaked into my back. The upstairs bathroom wasn't on the tax documents prior to the seller's ownership, it was part of the renovation. Someone fucked up bigly and since the house wasn't occupied after the renovation this is only now coming to light. Holy shit I'm crawling through three months of shit, my shit, my wife's shit, my father in law's shit! 

Memories of every shit I'd taken since moving in coursed through a mind imploding with revulsion like some nightmarish montage complete with the disembodied image of some arch nemesis cackling in the corner of the vision. We had numerous taco nights, I had discovered a sale on discount hot dogs a month earlier and had an entirely unrelated case of food poisoning a week after that was so bad I was showering instead of wiping. All of that was down here, with me, on me, soaking into me.

The panic set in and I scrambled up and over the mound that when it broke under my frantic grasping revealed yet-to-decompose toilet paper and slimy fecal matter complete with a visible kernel of corn, the metaphorical cherry on top of this unholy shit-cake that I was scrambling through.

Five minutes later my wife comes downstairs and finds me in the downstairs shower, which was also not attached to the sewer, crying hysterically, the stress of finding one thing after another leading up to me crawling through my own waste had been too much. I could only hope that in time the stains burned into my memory would fade.

Today we joke about it because what the fuck else can you do? We had it fixed, we moved on. We still can't believe we never smelled it bad enough to think more than a backed up drain. We started taking classes on how to repair your own home and are learning as much about basic home repair as we can. We are wiser and more capable today, this kind of disaster won't happen again.

As promised, video proof. https://youtu.be/tofGWfM6sJA

To answer your questions yes we had an inspector and no New York State does not hold inspectors liable for anything but after several other far more expensive issues and discovery of discrepancies in the sale documents an attorney has taken the case.

TL;DR I bought a house where the sellers had not attached the pipes to the sewer and the crawlspace prevented the inspector from catching it. I learned about this 3 months after the sale while crawling through the puddle of poops.

Throughout history there has to be at least one chef/cook that was executed because the royal food tester had a fatal allergic reaction to un-poisoned food.,,14354,2018-07-01 17:40:48,Showerthoughts,twistedmic,https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/8vb4s9/throughout_history_there_has_to_be_at_least_one/,/r/Showerthoughts/comments/8vb4s9/throughout_history_there_has_to_be_at_least_one/,8vb4s9,"Was the ""royal food tester"" (for poison) a real thing?

Because a lot of poisons would take some time before symptoms appear, especially if the ""taster"" only took a token bite.  If you waited long enough for this to be guaranteed useful, the food would be quite cold.

Well, cyanide poisoning shows up real fast though.  Or did they expect it to taste ""off""?  What does hemlock in soup taste like?  Did a guy taste, and spit out, common poisons to make himself an expert in what to expect?

I could imagine they thought this would be useful, or at least give the impression to others that poisoning attempts would not succeed and you'd be detected and executed for nothing?

I could also imagine a ""royal taster"" being employed to verify the *quality* of the food.  Like, ""I don't know what good borscht is even supposed to taste like, and can't be mocked for calling shit borscht to be great.  Bring me a culinary expert to verify the work of the chef.""

The presence of such a guy beside the king seems intrusive... this commoner is taking a bite of the king's food and drinking from his glass?  It seems like the opposite of the imagine of a confident, strong leader.  Like seeing the president only appear inside bulletproof glass.

"Downstairs neighbors wouldn't turn down ""music,"" nuked them from orbit.","Was suggested to [cross post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/8umt32/downstairs_neighbors_wouldnt_turn_down_music/) from /r/MaliciousCompliance

I was inspired by a [recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/8udmqo/downstairs_neighbor_complained_that_were_too_loud/) to tell my own bad neighbor story. Can't think of a better place to post it.

*Flashback to 2014... or so*

I moved out on my own in 2013 and moved into an old house converted into a 2 floor apartment, directly across from my future in-laws.

The downstairs neighbors were loud. BLARING music at all hours (yes, all of the hours), wouldn't cut the grass or take out the trash on our shared schedule. Crappy neighbors, but never bothered me directly. The guy was pretty chill when sober and would turn the music down a little when I texted him. He was okay until his girlfriend moved in. Now add shouting matches to the mix, and all of the sudden my requests to turn down the music makes him turn it up. I can barely walk on my super-thin floor without her banging on the ceiling with a broom.

I was okay since I am heavy sleeper and could sleep through anything. My wife moved in, and I quickly found out that she is quite the opposite. Fan on turned at a certain angle in the doorway of the bathroom, door closed half way, blackout curtains with them taped to the wall so zero light comes through, zero sounds other than the fan, you get the idea.

I told her that we can't expect them to remain silent when she's ready for bed, we need to be reasonable, but the wall rattling music needs to stop during the night. She hated it during the day, but I told her there's nothing we can do then, so she would go to her parent's house a lot during the day.

I talked to neighbor-guy, he said ""yeah man that's cool"" but it turns out the girlfriend wasn't having it and his attitude then changed to ""yeah well it's our house so you can go F yourself if you think you can tell us what to do and you can move out if you don't like it.""

Something definitely had to change once she was pregnant, and then the baby came.

So I did the only thing I could do. I fought fire with fire, and **maliciously complied** with the law to the T. I could only report them for noise after 11:00 PM. I now forget the morning hour when the noise could start, but I believe it was 9:00 AM.

My dad has these huge old concert speakers in his garage. Professional grade, black leather bound, 5 feet tall and 3 feet wide, and a pretty nice, vintage stereo/amp.

He has two, but my apartment was so small I sadly only had room for one. We replaced our coffee table with this thing, laid face down onto our thin, office carpet.

Tired of his crap tunes, I tested this Geneva Convention-breaking device when they weren't home.

**Holy cow.**

I had to take everything down from tables, counters and shelves because they would shake off. I prepared audio files to feed the stereo. I was giddy like a kid with a new Christmas toy. I turned it on when I left for work and got my wife up to send her to her parents. I came home from work and hung out at her parents until it was close to bed time.

They resisted for 3 days.

On day 2, I found a pile of manure on my doorstep, but it didn't faze me.

I cycled between sine/saw/square waves in clashing chords, marching music (Washington Post March on loop), preaching clips (they weren't just atheist, but outspoken anti-Christian, so it was a must), the most stupid songs you could think of (Captain Planet theme song, Chicken dance, etc).

This poor old house rattled in ways I didn't think possible. The vibrations from the sine wave would make your vision blur.

I eventually got a text from him that read ""sorry man you can stop now.""

I did not.

A Philadelphia Nerlens Noel jersey is the most patriotic jersey to wear today,"Start with the obvious; a Philadelphia 76ers jersey is going to be the most patriotic to wear on Independence Day, as the team name comes from 1776, the year the Declaration of Independence was signed and why we celebrate the Fourth of July. Additionally, the jersey is red, white, and blue no matter if its home, road, or alternate.

Nerlens Noel is who you you want on that Sixers jersey. His number was 4, obviously representing July 4th. Additionally, his name, Noel, signifies that America took ""no L"" in fighting for our independence. 

In conclusion; everyone wear your Philadelphia Nerlens Noel jerseys today.

"[Lloyd] It has been made clear to me by multiple people, Kyrie never wanted LeBron to come back in the first place. (After a Miami game) LeBron said keep doing what you're doing, you never know I could be back one day. Kyrie in the locker room said ""What's he talking about? We don't need that guy.""","[Short clip of that story](https://streamable.com/usan1) 

The 3 main beat writers (Dave McMenamin-ESPN, Joe Vardon-Cleveland.com, and Jason Lloyd-The Athletic) that covered the Cavs over the past 4 years just did a podcast together, giving an inside look at the Cavs team and the relationships between the players.


**A lot of interesting notes from the podcast:**


- Vardon and McMenamin were notified by LeBron's camp (or maybe the Cavs camp. They were vague on this) on Thursday, before lebron opted out, that the Lakers decision was pretty much a done deal.


- Immediately after the 2016 Championship, someone important in LeBron's camp told Vardon that LeBron's next plan was to go to the Lakers to 'play with his friends' (Vardon believes the 'friends' part meant the banana boat)


- Kyrie never made strong relationships within the Cavs organization/FO, both before and while LeBron was in CLE. Kyrie didn't like Mike Brown because Larry Hughes, a client of Kyrie's agent, already had a bad relationship with Brown. There was also serious debate within the Cavs to choose Dion Waiters over Kyrie at one point. 


- Kyrie didn't like Lue very much, especially after Ty Lue told the media that ""players need to put their brands aside"", meaning Love and Kyrie need to stop worrying about endorsements and trust LeBron to lead the team. Ty Lue admitted to Dave McMenamin that Kyrie has treated him like a stranger since day 1 and that it is 'impossible to break through to him'. (which may have been why Kyrie made those remarks this year about coaching styles) 


- Kyrie did not appreciate LeBron questions directed at him. McMenamin was writing a story about LeBron's improved 3 point shot but Kyrie was annoyed when he approached him about any noticeable changes in LeBron's technique. The media also made a deal about LeBron wearing the ""I can't breathe"" shirts, despite Kyrie being the first Cav to wear it. All 3 reporters believe this clearly bothered Kyrie.


- Lloyd approached Lebron at the start of this past season and told him that 'you and Kyrie hid the poor status of the relationship very well the past few years' and LeBron agreed (although Lloyd could not reveal the exact quote) 


- Kyrie and his camp considered leaving after the championship but decided otherwise. Kyrie's father wanted a bigger role in the organization and did not appreciate LeBron's friend, Randy Mims, having a position within the organization. 


- A big reason why Kyrie wanted out of CLE last year is because he felt the team was built to support LeBron's strengths, and if LeBron left, Kyrie would only be left with those parts that benefitted LeBron's game. Kyrie also told FO that he would opt for surgery if they didn't trade him last year. 


- The flat earth drama really bothered Kyrie. Didn't like that he was receiving attention now instead of about more serious topics (political and social) like Lebron


- LeBron and Love's relationship was rocky in the very first year because Love came to camp out of shape.


- Kyrie did not talk to any of his teammates between last years Indiana and Toronto series. Not even during practices. 


- The most dejected the reporters have ever seen LeBron after a game was after Game 6 Finals in 2015. Lebron sat at his locker for about an hour with a towel over his head. The second most dejected was after Game 1 this year. After winning two Game 7's, hitting 2 buzzer beaters, beating higher seeds, with a new team and without Kyrie, scoring 51 points against the Warriors, all the air went out of him.


- LeBron did not just hit the whiteboard once. He bashed at it several times.


- The JR Smith soup throwing story is one of ESPN'S top 10 stories of the year. They believe the thing that started the drama may have just been simple teasing or a shooting competition that escalated


- Wade played a major role in the mid-season team meeting. Cavs felt like locker room was irreparable after that and was a reason he was shipped back to Miami


- LeBron would always talk to McMenamin about LA (Hotspots and restaurants), as Dave used to cover the Lakers. Lloyd joked with LeBron throughout the year about him leaving after this season but LeBron genuinely seemed unsure of his decision


- Cavs had two players on their radar during the draft. Trae Young, who Gilbert wanted, and Sexton who most of the organization wanted. They had considered Porter until his medical records came out. 


- They all believe that after hearing Klay's post-Game 4 remarks about basketball being a ""man's game"" and that **LeBron must have ""gotten his feelings hurt""**, LeBron's demeanor shifted entirely and was the turning point of the 2016 Finals. Lebron was in a good mood during shootaround that morning until he heard about those comments. [I recommend everyone to watch LeBron's reaction if you haven't seen It.](https://youtu.be/NQNXw1gKt-o) 



I'm sure I missed some stuff but its worth [listening to the podcast if you get time](https://923thefan.radio.com/articles/cavs-roundtable-discussion-jason-lloyd-dave-mcmenamin-and-joe-vardon) ",4237,2018-07-06 02:09:41,nba,mrilly,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8wfw96/lloyd_it_has_been_made_clear_to_me_by_multiple/,/r/nba/comments/8wfw96/lloyd_it_has_been_made_clear_to_me_by_multiple/,8wfw96,">  Kyrie's father wanted a bigger role in the organization and did not appreciate LeBron's friend, Randy Mims, having a position withing the organization.

Yesterday a developer on the ArenaNet's narrative team, Jessica Price, made [[this comment]](https://twitter.com/Delafina777/status/1014554296107483136) when a Youtuber/Streamer (who is in the official ArenaNet partnerprogram) Deroir gave his take on the topic of player character design in Guild Wars 2 after Price was not pleased with comments in AMA posted earlier here.

Her reply can be taken as falsely claiming that Deroir only left this comment because she is a female developer. Deroir replied that it was not his intentions, but the discussion didn't care and rest you can view in her Twitter page.

Also during this ""incident"" another developer, also in the story side, Peter Fries replied to Price's comments saying that she was in the right, that it was indeed sexism. Both have ~~now apparently~~ possibly been fired from their job (no official notice).

There is no mistake that it was people power that made this happen. Before the vote, MEP Catherine Stihler of Scotland [noted](http://www.businessinsider.com/eu-parliament-rejects-sweeping-internet-copyright-reforms-2018-7) that she had received a petition signed by a million people against the changes. Other MEPs noted the deluge of calls and letters that they had received leading up to the vote. 

This outpouring of activism about what most people would have considered a dull procedural vote would not have been possible without the awareness and urgency (and, yes, [super-dank memes](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qvny8v/some-genius-memers-are-creatively-fighting-the-eus-possible-meme-ban)) that members of the Reddit community raised, and we’d like to particularly congratulate r/Europe for leading the way. They hosted informative AMAs with [MEP Julia Reda](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8oywxz/i_am_mep_julia_reda_fighting_to_saveyourinternet/) and Europe’s leading [independent experts on copyright reform](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8ugrow/eu_copyright_ama_we_are_professors_lionel_bently/), they kept everyone up to date on vote progress and outcomes (check out [their tally of the July 5th vote](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8wblrj/mep_votes_on_the_eu_copyright_directive_by_name/) to see how your MEP voted), and they [used megathreads](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8q1mfc/on_the_eu_copyright_reform/) to keep us all in the loop about what was happening and how to help. 

# What’s Next?

This isn’t over yet. The really important thing about this vote is that it takes what would have been pushed through into law behind closed doors and opens it up to a more public debate process, where citizens have the ability to weigh in, share their views, and build a compromise that protects rightsholders without imperiling free expression. 

The next vote will likely be on 10 September, and the coming weeks are critical to ensuring that the MEPs charged with hammering out amendments and drafting that compromise hear from their constituents.

[RESOLVED NE] HOA tried to take my land,"So after 6 long months, everything been resolved. This is my final post regarding this, already asked my lawyer if I could post this and he said go ahead. 

So here's my last update:  

https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7go96c/ne_hoa_towed_away_my_car_and_built_a_chainlink/


So the HOA board got a lawyer to respond to my C&D and they requested a meeting ASAP with my lawyer present as well. I didn't want to go but my lawyer suggested me hear them out at atleast. At the meeting, I noticed there president and some of the higher ups were not there. 

The board had no idea what the hell was happening and their lawyer was just as confused as them. After I laid out my timeline of events they thanked me for my time accepted all the financial burden of replenishing my pond, missing car (couldn't locate it), and damages. 

I got checks for everything and got my pond restored back in April and didn't really think much of it. 

I found out a few weeks ago from the new HOA president. Turns out the old president, tresaurer and someone else had been stealing money from the coffers. They wanted my land to expand and put in a pool, clubhouse and etc just as I saw on their website. The old board fined everyone a ton of money to get all the cash together and buy my land. Instead they spent it on themselves. They needed my land somehow so they thought they could just take over the land I wasn't using.


Long story short, their entire plan fell apart after I fought back and brought to the other members of the HOA attention what they were doing. From what I've been told, they had to sell their house to pay back the HOA and have since moved away. The HOA has offered me market value for my land and I do plan on selling since I really don't use the land for anything and the money isn't bad.

I did not file any complaints with the Postal inspector or anything, since the situation resolved itself. I got a new project car and for those asking it was a '98 Supra with a bad engine. My new project is a '67 Fastback that I plan on restoring to look like Elanor. :)

I want to thank a ton of redditors for chiming in with advice including a few from Nebraska. 

/u/silvoan
/u/immo406
/u/dracofaerie2
/u/whatarestairs
and others that PMed with advice and support.

We are glad you are visiting. There are a few things you should know before you post here:

**We lock update posts that do not contain additional questions**. There are two reasons for this. First, this is a forum for legal advice and if none is sought, none will be offered. Second, those posts were moderating nightmares filled with off topic ranting and pointless arguments. We welcome update posts - particularly when a poster reports that they used our advice successfully. Even when they are locked in r/legaladvice there is almost always a discussion of the update in r/bestoflegaladvice for your popcorn needs.

**Nothing here constitutes the formation of an attorney/client relationship**. This is not a substitute for an informed local attorney. At best, the advice herein assists the posters in taking the first step toward resolving their legal issue.  

**We are not a popcorn sub**. We remove posts and ban posters who do not participate in good faith. We lock posts that meander off topic, devolve into pointless bickering, or result in too many reports to the mods. This is not to say that there isn't entertainment to be found here, indeed that is why most of us became involved in the law. It is fun. And when justice results, it is rewarding as well. 

**Our rules are in the sidebar to your right**. They are available in detail [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3jm6u2/the_law_of_the_land_please_read_before/) and our wiki is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index). For those of you who want more popcorn and fewer vegetables we invite you to visit our sister subs /r/bestoflegaladvice and /r/legaladviceofftopic. 

**Shitposting and brigading will earn you a permanent ban**. We respond to the situation at hand and the laws that apply.  This is not the place to grind your political axe or talk about what you think the law should be. If you want to change the law, get involved in local politics. 

**Personal anecdotes are not useful**. This is not the place to talk about how once your sister's roommate got out of a ticket by doing X. The fact that you have an anecdotal counterexample is not proof that the advice offered is wrong. 

**This is legal advice, not moral advice**. Sometimes we have posts on hot button issues such as abortion, child custody, rape, racial prejudice, sexism, and so on. People come here to learn about their legal options. Advice relating to their immortal souls can be found elsewhere on reddit, online, and at local mosques, churches, temples, and philosophy departments. Sometimes, however, legal advice is indistinguishable from life advice.

Thank you for visiting our sub. We hope you enjoy your time here and consider subscribing.

"I was born and raised in a NY Hasidic community, completely isolated from Secular society. AMA","As the title says, I was born and raised in the Hasidic community. For those of you that are unfamiliar what Hasidim are, the Hasidic community is a very religious and traditional community, with a lot of strict rules and customs. There’s a very big focus on staying isolated and not letting in any outside secular influences, which in result creates a very tight nit and family oriented community. 
Almost everything in our lifestyle is completely different from regular society. From the biggest thing in life, like family, marriage, education, language etc, to the most little ones like, which shirt you’re allowed to wear, or which number blade you’re allowed to cut your hair. 
There’s so much interesting experiences and observations that I can write about. It probably requires a whole book. But I’ll leave it up for your questions! 

Thanks for reading!

Ps. I’m not in the position to put my face in public so the IAmA mods have verified my authenticity confidentiality. 

Edit 1: I thought I might get some questions but I wasn’t expecting sooo much so fast. I really thank you for your interest and asking questions!
English is not my first language and I’ve never formally learned to write English well. It takes me long to respond, but I’ll try to answer every question slowly. I’ll be back in a hour or two. 

Edit 2: I was out for a while and just checked back in, I’m speechless. I really do appreciate each and everyone that responds, I really want to answer every single comment. (I’m usually on the other end where I wait for the OP to respond) I feel like I want to grab a mic and scream shhhh, I’ll get to you all, just one at a time. But as of now I don’t see a mic button on the app. 

It seems that if I answer the top question that already have hundreds of sub comments, my answer gets buried on the bottom. I think I’ll try for now to answer the newer ones and see how that works.

"[OC][Art] I convinced my family to play, had their characters drawn by an amazing artist",,4668,2018-07-05 21:09:03,DnD,thelivingdrew,https://i.redd.it/v77d8o9as6811.jpg,/r/DnD/comments/8wdnoh/ocart_i_convinced_my_family_to_play_had_their/,8wdnoh,"Back Story:
The day after thanksgiving I got my whole family to play. Here’s how I did it:

~~A month ago~~ I got my sister and her boyfriend to start playing while I DM’d via Skype. We made a plan to play when I was out east for thanksgiving. After the normal amount of skepticism I was able to get three more family members convinced to do a one-off.

I started by making Level 3 characters for the new people the day before we played. I aimed to make the characters as close to their personality types as possible.

Younger Sister (Wood Elf, Druid, Sage) She’s in college and likes to be in her books. She’s not confrontational. I explained she can stay behind the front lines and assist.

Her Boyfriend (Dragonborn, Bard, Outlander) He’s a bit awkward, plays in a band, and likes to travel.

Older Sister (Wood Elf, Ranger, Charlatan) She likes gardening, her dogs, and being a hussy from time to time.

Her Boyfriend (Human, Rogue, Noble) He’s rich and likes tinkering with stuff off on his own.

Mom (Half-Elf, Paladin, Acolyte)
The Pope is the only person she holds in higher esteem than Ronald Reagan. I explained she could protect us all with the power of God. She was sold.

After fifteen minutes or so of staring at their character sheets we did “The Wild Sheep Chase.” It was just enough time that by the time we got through two random encounters they had the hang of dealing with NPC’s and even knew the names and purposes of the dice. By the time we go to the big-bad they were “professionals.”

What was most exciting was that they all jumped into their characters and it was almost like being in the world of D&D with my family.

They all acted like fantasy versions of themselves which made for enough eye-rolling and cutting remarks like “yeah I bet you would,” going as far as my mom getting mad at my sister when she tried to seduce a guard while using a false identity.

TL;dr: made level 3 characters that reflected the personality-types of my family members for a one-off. They enjoyed it.


Please go see [ribkadory](https://www.instagram.com/ribkadory_art) or email her at ribkadoryart@gmail.com and give her all the business she derserves.  She is an amazing artist and was incredibly professional from start to finish.   She rolled with a ton of critiques and nitpicks and provided an amazing work I intend to hang over my game table.

Lady assumed I was stealing,"I was going to post this in r/idoworkherelady but that sub looks pretty dead so I thought I’d actually post it here. A woman thought I was stealing an employee golf cart at my job. I tried to explain to her I was an employee but she wouldn’t listen 

I work golf maintenance at a very fancy golf course during the summers while in college and I did it in high school too. I was working the driving range one day and getting stuff ready and this lady is hitting golf balls and decides to come over to me, red in the face, and say “Excuse me young man you aren’t allowed to use that cart, didn’t you’re grandparents tell you?” 
I say to her “ma’am I work here I’m most definitely allowed to use the cart.” She then looks like she is sucking a lemon and says “don’t lie to me I know you’re staying with your grandparents for 4th of July and you stole a cart from one of those damn Mexicans who actually work here trying to be cute.” I was floored I had no idea what to say because I couldn’t believe she felt the need to not only be racist towards my coworkers/friends but also condescending towards me. 
I just go “alright ma’am, I need to get back to work.” 
She grabs my arm and says “no you’re coming with me, I know the general manager and he will throw you out personally.” I grin and say “alright fine then I’ll come with you. We take her cart back to the clubhouse and go in to the general managers office. She goes through the whole rant saying how I stole a cart and pretended to be an employee and got very loud and then after she finished she says “what do you have to say for yourself?” I turn to the GM and say “well Dad you see the thing is...” and she interjects “wait, this is your son?? You let your son go and steal carts from the help?” My father just says “ma’am he works here, there is no problem.” She got extremely embarrassed and just left.

* Been to the rescue camp site almost everyday

Edit: It's been great, I didn't know there's this much international attention (even though I'm working with an international media agency). I'll get some sleep in a bit, 3-4 hours of sleep daily is unhealthy af, so I'd like to get some shut eye now.

I'll check back to see if there are unique and interesting questions and answer them :)

"LPT: Modems are the biggest racket in the cable business. Don't opt for theirs, you pay $12/month for life, as apposed to the one time cost of $30 - $100. Only set up required is giving the ISP the Mac address on the box, and you dont have to wait for the installer to come ""between 8am and 2pm""","I used to work for an ISP B2B sales team. They paid us well for selling rented Modems because usually they were used, given back by the last renter. Or if they renter didn't return them, they still have to replace it with a new one. So it was recurring revenue without a cost to the ISP 

And no, there is no advantage to renting. They don't service Modems rented differently than one you bought
___________________

Edit: To address everyone saying that their ISP ""requires"" use of the company's router, or that techs cost money:

Ive seen reps say the ISP modem rental was required, thats pushy sales tactics -most of the time. Just tell them emphatically you want to buy your own. **The router/modem model is important, make sure you ask your ISP what model/combo to buy**

Techs are no cost when its first installed because its the outside lines, into your house. The same goes for internet issues. You again, emphatically tell customer care that the issue is not with the hardware but with the wiring outside/to your box. They are pushy, like the car repair business. They know most people dont know better, so they embellish on facts and swindle a lot of people out of money due to ignorance

“Two kids are out. They are currently at the field hospital near the cave,” said Tossathep Boonthong, chief of Chiang Rai’s health department and part of the rescue team.

“We are giving them a physical examination. They have not been moved to Chiang Rai hospital yet,” Tossathep told Reuters.


EDIT: **UPDATE**

**FOUR BOYS CONFIRMED RESCUED**. The remaining 8 boys and their coach remain at the original underground location near to Pattaya beach, suggesting that previous reports that six boys had been freed were inaccurate.

The rescue has been concluded for the night and will resume in 10-20 hours because “we’ve used all the oxygen,” according to Narongsak, who said the healthiest were taken out first.

“For the next operation to happen, we cannot say. It will be between 10 and 20 hours, but not over 20. But we have to evaluate all the factors.

“Air tanks must be put back into place,” he added, noting that today’s progress was a “great success”.",CA[deleted],4591,2018-07-08 10:52:49

"UPDATE 2: I [31M] found out my fiance cheated during her [30F] bachelorette party, planning on leaving","I am making this as I feel I owe it to all of you. The amount of PM's and responses have been incredible. Many of the decisions i have taken has come from people who supported me on reddit. Both the negative and positive comments have helped me and I would like to thank all of you for taking the time to write me and support me.

Yesterday I was having my phone spammed by many family members from her side, and friends. The only person I responsed to was the sister with part of the conversation where she and the sister talks about it all. I didnt include anything in the response except an image the conversation, and the sister went pretty much silent after that (until later).

During the day i contact the co-owner of my business and let him know the full story, he told me to take as much time as I need and even adviced me to head off to a vacation (this guy is a childhood friend of mine, i dont trust anyone as much as him). My plans have changed a bit, I am still staying at this hotel for another few days and then perhaps moving on to the friend I was supposed to go to. I called him up and let him know I want to head off somewhere, perhaps a trip to somewhere nice, another country or something, its all still not yet 100% decided, but I know i will be leaving for somewhere. He said he would be up for joining me if it could be during the upcoming weeks since he is still on holiday from his work. We will see how that turns out...

Later in the day I responded to my wife, the calls kept coming in less frequently since I sent that message to her sister... i had this gut feeling she was going to come with an excuse of some sort.
I picked up the phone and first thing i hear is a ""torn up voice"" if u can say that in english. I could hear she had been crying all day and was in a messed up state. She kept begging me to come back, that there is an explanation to everything and that she loves me. She I have misunderstood the entire situation... I could hear the sister and someone else in the background (dont know who the other person was, maybe her friend?). Anyway I told her to explain it to me right then and there. She said because I only seen a small part of the conversation its all been misunderstood, that I should come back home, that she loves me and that i have taken a rational decision to leave without a real reason. During the entire conversation i was just giving really short, empty answers in a cold way like ""yea, ok, what, explain it to me""...
After she told me its all a misunderstanding I told her to call me back in 10 minutes, and to check messenger.
After I hungup, i sent her the entire conversation log, with a ton of screenshots (not all of them, but most of the important ones). It didnt take 2 minutes for her to call back, crying hysterically saying sorry for everything, saying she wants to die rather than to lose me. She said she was ""forced"" by her friends and sister to have fun one last time, that she needed to let all the energy out before stepping into a marriage for life. I was just quiet during most of it. The more I didnt talk and just said ""ok"" the more she was crying.

She started telling me I can fuck other women if I want to get back at her, or that she will tell everyone about what she did so i can take her back, that she will do anything it takes for me to come back and that this was a mistake of her life and that she hates her sister and friends for this...
I told her fucking other woman was not something I needed, because the moment i met her and started loving her, she was the only woman i needed, i didnt need to meet or sleep with someone to know the best thing of my life was waiting at home. 
The sister was telling her stuff in the background but I couldnt hear, i dont know what the sister was telling her or if she was getting angry at her or something.

She kept begging me and begging me, and i just told her, if she comes clean to her parents and family i will think about it. After that she started saying something but I just hung up. 

For like half an hour my phone goes silent without much response, and her father calls me up and apologizes for everything, he and his wife know what happened now, and he is so sorry for all of this. He told me he understands how i feel and that he didnt raise his daughter to do this, he said he understand if i dont want to see her again but that I always will be welcome to him and that I am a good guy. His wife basically then takes/steals the phone from him and tells me she did a mistake and she regrets it and it will never happen again and that we can move forward from this. She tells me her daughter has never been this destroyed before. I politely tell her I appreciate her opinion and then say i have to go and goodbye.

My ex-fiance calls me back and beggs me again saying she told her parents and also sent a text message to her friends (our mutual friends) about what had happened. She then keeps crying asking me when i will come back to speak with her, and say we can even go to counselling and that she will pay for everything.
She kept apologizing and apoliogizing on the phone and I didnt say much.

After some time I just told her not to cry, that she shouldnt be apologizing because single women (like herself) are allowed to do these things and i hope she finds mr right. She starts crying even harder and her sister takes the phone and say sorry and tells me everything can be fixed and that I said I would take her back now that she told everyone what she did. I told the sister I only said I think about it, and now that I have I realised i dodged a bullet and wish her and her sister the best. She then tells me her sister is turning suicidal from all of this and that this is going to lead into a depression that can take her life. 
The only thing I said after she told me that was ""its a good thing you are close to her so you can make sure she doesnt kill herself then, maybe take her to a doctor or soemthing"". After this I just hung up.

My phone has been blowing up with messages from mutual friends, her and her sister saying sorry and basically begging me to come back. I dont plan on responding. I honestly feel ALOT better right now, like I can move on. I will be going for vacation this upcoming week i think. If someting more happens I will update this post.

Maybe I will update in a month or couple of weeks, i dont know.
Once again big thanks to all of you who supported me here on reddit and gave me so much support.

I dont know when I feel okay to start dating/meeting women again but we will see. Once again thanks to you all and sorry for alot of wrong writings, I am not a native english so hope you can read without issues.

Thanks!

EDIT 1: Thank you to whoever gave me reddit gold I appreciate the support ALOT. I however will not be using this account for anything else except this post or maybe a couple of updates in the future, is it possible to refund it to whoever gave it to me somehow?

I would also like to add my best friend (co-owner of my company) hired someone to take care of the company for us, and also booked a month long vacation for the both of us. I am lucky to have such a good person in my life, and i hope you all are able to find a friend like this (i would do the same for him). Hes been a friend since we were kids and if i lost all other people i know he would be there for me, so big thanks to him!

Also I dont know what more to update at this point, alot of things have happened so if you have any questions feel free to ask and I will reply as they popup in the comments (i didnt know what other things you were wondering about me or the situation).

Almost every government in the world agrees with the scientific consensus.

The US seems the last outlier here & purely for political reasons.

I think the idea of collective global action for social good & ending the Oil & Coal Industries terrifies American conservatives.

Then the other day, I saw ""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"" and it was a pivotal song for Merlin, who was a huge John Denver fan, and highlighted one of the most iconic scenes in the film.

Last night, I watched ""Alien: Covenant"" and there it was again as a digital echo of Elizabeth Shaw from ""Prometheus.""

There is room for a nuanced discussion about breast feeding, children’s nutritional needs and societal norms. I went into the article prepared to roll my eyes at potentially another public health story framed through the lens of “lol, Trump and America are stupid”.

But holy fuck, the behavior of the US diplomatic mission, as described in the article, is unconscionable.

> American officials sought to water down the resolution by removing language that called on governments to “protect, promote and support breast-feeding” and another passage that called on policymakers to restrict the promotion of food products that many experts say can have deleterious effects on young children.

> When that failed, they turned to threats,

> The Americans were blunt: If Ecuador refused to drop the resolution, Washington would unleash punishing trade measures and withdraw crucial military aid. The Ecuadorean government quickly acquiesced.

> Health advocates scrambled to find another sponsor for the resolution, but at least a dozen countries, most of them poor nations in Africa and Latin America, backed off, citing fears of retaliation, according to officials from Uruguay, Mexico and the United States.
“What happened was tantamount to blackmail, with the U.S. holding the world hostage and trying to overturn nearly 40 years of consensus on best way to protect infant and young child health,” she said.

> In the end, the Americans’ efforts were mostly unsuccessful. **It was the Russians who ultimately stepped in to introduce the measure — and the Americans did not threaten them.**

Fuck that. I hope this story continues to get traction. I want answers from the State Department about this.

TIFU by meeting up with a girl online,"So this happened two days ago, I tried to make a legit tifu but my mind was not in the right headspace.

A couple months ago I matched with a girl from a dating app. Fortunately I'm six feet tall so I'm not ugly, but I honestly don't get too many matches. Looking over her profile, she's surprisingly attractive. She doesn't have much else of a profile, very little details and only has two photos. I figure it's a spam account or a catfish or something, but with my luck, lets roll the dice baby! We message and replies are practically days apart, the ol' ""how are you"", ""what'd you do over the weekend"", blah blah, the conversation isn't really going anywhere but she asks me if I use fb messenger.

Call it what you want but girls do not usually make the first move to take the conversation outside of the app. She tells me to add her, she gives me a fake name, think stripper name like 'Angela Champagne'. And not only that, she only has about four pics, two of her which are super old, and her profile photo is one of those cartoons you see from an emo/scene girl's tumblr/blogspot from 2012. I'm skeptical as hell but haven't had female interaction in months! Let's play :)

So I message her, and still more small talk, responses take hours to days. She asks me if I smoke (weed), I say yeah. Call me old fashioned but I could've sworn I was supposed to be a boy and initiate talk towards things of that nature. She says ""If you're ever around the area, I'll smoke you out"". Okay, this sounds waaaaaay too good to be true. But I'm an idiot so we plan to smoke in a couple days when we're both free. So the day comes and we message a little bit and I confirm if we're still good to smoke and chill. She says yeah, she's finishing up dinner with some friends and tells me to come by after, it's about 11pm. I ask for an address but no response. An hour later I message ""raincheck?"" No answer til the next day and she says ""Pls let me make it up to you, by feeding you lots of weed"". At this point I just feel like I'm being played for whatever reason. No explanation of what happened, but I play along.

We message rarely, she says she's traveling for a bit and won't be back for two weeks, a message here for a week, another there. She returns and says she wants to smoke soon, I oblige. The day comes, I message her around 9pm, she responds around 10pm saying ""just had dinner with friends"" (this sounds fami**liar**). I ask if she's down to smoke and chill, she doesn't respond until 11:30pm and asks if I'd be willing to smoke a little bit later? At this point I just feel like I'm going to get setup and stabbed. I feel like all that time in-between to respond she's messaging her friends to plan something out to get me. I tell her I can't make any promises and she hits me back with the ""Kinda horny haha"".

Really? Yeah, there's no way this is legit, I'm ready to call ""her"" out. She then tells me to meet her at the park by her house. Yeah, sure thing buddy. And just to drop a detail, this isn't the first time I've been catfished, fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, you can't get fooled again!

Anyways so it turns out I'm willing to die for my primal instinct of mating. I'm driving to the park, it's about 1am at this point. About 2 blocks before I get there, I pull over and rummage through the door panel of my car. I keep a knife and some pepper spray for those you never know what's gonna happen moments. The knife and pepper spray has been sitting for about 5 years now. I put the knife in my pocket and test the pepper spray to see if it even works anymore by spraying it out of my window. Ironically, the last time I used it was 5 years ago to test it, and my stupid ass, maybe two hours after playing with it go about my day and rub my eye. Bad idea (a different tifu story). So I'm thinking fuck that, this isn't happening again, so I rinse my hand off with my water bottle and figure I'll just wash it if I ever make it inside this girl's house.

So I get to the park but have no idea where I'm supposed to be. I'm super weary and park a little off to the side of the park so that I could see the neighborhood. I turn off the car and my lights and text her that I'm there and she said she's coming out. So now I wait.. My eyes are shifting, and my nerves are high, I look in my rear view to make sure no one is running up on me. I look up the street and see someone. It's a small, slim girl in a tank top and short shorts. I don't know how to feel right now, my eyes continue to be on the lookout. She sees my car down the block and tells me to park closer. I turn on my car and slowly drive towards the house and park in front. There's another car in the driveway, it's a white SUV, maybe her boyfriend who's planning to kill me? Probably.

I get out of the car and try and see her better and slowly make my way towards her. We have one of those first meeting type hugs. She looks like what she was supposed to look like for the most part as my poor eyes try to adjust to the darkness that is the night. She asks if I want any water and says she has some guests over (not sure if I should be concerned). Also asked what I wanted to smoke, she says she has dabs and I say sure? She tells me her guests don't know she smokes so she's gonna run in the house and bring it out. She comes back out with her dabs, a rig, and a torch in a bag and asks if we can smoke in my car. I'm surprised, I begin to let my guard down a bit.

We sit in the car, small talk, she's setting up the dab rig. I tell her to show me how to do it as I don't smoke enough to know and she happily obliges. As she's setting up, she says sorry and asks me if I can hold this and that for her, says thank you after the smallest task, just super nice. I'm thinking is this for real? I hit the dab (no pun intended), and get pretty damn high pretty damn fast. I don't smoke a lot but I do know dabs are pretty much the strongest high you can achieve. And then I'm thinking maybe she's trying to get me so high that I can't function and someone is gonna come out and rob me. I'm good off of one hit, she does a total of three, and the entire time she's super nice and coherent, you wouldn't even believe she was high.

We talk a little more and I'm super baked, my thoughts are running on auto-pilot at this point. She says she pretty much smokes everyday and that she suffers from insomnia but weed doesn't help. I ask her what she usually does to help her sleep better and she says ""I masturbate"". My eyes open wide and I'm high as a kite at this point and my heart begins to race. She asks if I want to go to the park and we make our way over. We sit on the bench and it's dark, we begin to make  out a little and I rub her through her shorts. She's liking it and I proceed to put my hand down her pants but it's a little dry. I was going to use my mouth, but figured it'd be sexier if I put my fingers in her mouth so I did. I proceed to play with her and things are getting pretty hot and heavy. She says ""did you eat something spicy?"" Confused, I answer ""what?"" She says again, nervously, ""did you eat something spicy?"" And then I realized.. No fucking way.. This isn't happening.. I was so high I completely forgot about the pepper spray on my hands! My brain on auto-pilot still, ""what, nahhh, uh, why do you ask?"" She kind uncomfortably laughs and says ""it kind of burns."" I don't fucking believe it. I'm sitting there with her on my lap, my hands still down her pants, screeeeeeaming inside. This is unreal, there's no way this is real. This doesn't happen to people. This is shit you see on reddit in tifu. I begin to laugh at myself. She asks ""what did you eat, it really burns, I hope this isn't an std or something,  haha..."" I don't know what to say, the story is too ridiculous for her to believe! I just say ""uhhh, some Hot Cheetos, yeah.."" She replies, ""Did you wash your hands because it really really burns!"" ""Yeah, of course I did. But we should probably go wash up."" I say still blazed out of my mind. I want to tell her the truth so bad but don't know how because of how crazy it is and how embarrassed I am. I'm just laughing at myself in disbelief, I'm blown away.

Let me explain how high I was. I felt like I was watching a movie. I could see everything happening from a 3rd person point of view, it was surreal. I couldn't believe it was real life and I'm just sitting there laughing in her face while the most sensitive, nerve-rich part of her body is on fire (twice as sensitive your penis head). I could not comprehend the severity of what she was feeling at the moment as I continued to giggle due to being high. She is very clearly upset, she gets up and says ""I'm gonna go now."" And I don't know what to do, I'm literally at a loss for words! She walks back towards my car to get her stuff, I say ""It's not what you think! It's not an std or anything, uhm.."" She's like ""uhuh, yeah I know what it is. Whatever, you just go around and chili girls?"" And I immediately respond with ""Chili girls, no, wait, what? What does that even mean?! I just..!"" She's kind of like whatever at this point and I feel like I need to blurt out anything that I can to explain what happened. ""I have pepper spray and like, it leaked out onto my hands!"" She says, ""Uhuh, it just leaked. When were you planning to use it on me?"" I go ""Why would I want to pepper spray you, that makes no sense!!"" And at this point she's done and goes inside the house.

I'm sitting in my car, high as fuck thinking to myself did that just happen. I force myself to drive up the street away from her house and park in a small parking lot (don't drive under the influence kids). If there was someone else in the car with me, the only words you would've heard out of my mouth for the next 30 minutes were ""Holy shit"", ""What the fuck"", ""Oh my god"", followed by giggles and shaking of the head in disbelief. I felt absolutely terrible about what happened. I messaged her trying my best to explain myself but yeah.. I actually tried to make this tifu in the car that night but I was way too high to comprehend anything and put my thoughts down. Check the username and join date.

"When we say it's not pumpable, that means it won't work with the pump.","I'm a truck driver.  More specifically, I drive a concrete mixer.  That means a large part of my job is dealing with people who know nothing about the material, nothing about my equipment, but still think they know better than me, since I'm obviously just an evil-smelling, gap-toothed hillbilly who didn't graduate high school.  In short, concrete is what happens when Malicious Compliance goes for a drunken joyride down the Dunning-Kruger Parkway.  
  
So, on this particular day, I was pouring at a school out in the middle of nowhere.  Our plant was the closest one to the jobsite, but it was still a half-hour away.  It was also over 110 degrees (schools usually do their renovation and repair work in summer).  The order indicated that they were going to use a concrete pump, and the manager (we will call him Bob) told me to throw in some fiber.  There are a few different kinds of fiber we use, but the only one that works with a trailer pump consists of small squares woven out of a cotton-like material that come apart in the mix.  I throw that in, because it's a pump job.
  
So we get onto the jobsite, and start pumping.  Everything is going well for the first couple yards.  Then the pump's reducer (a pipe running across the front of the pump) snaps, swing out and slams into my foot.  I wasn't hurt, but it turned out the pumper knew the pipe was getting thin and ran with it anyways.  Now I'm pissed; those pumps operate at massive pressures, and I have seen them blow concrete hard enough to knock a man over 20 feet away.  If I hadn't been wearing steel toes, it very well might have broken something.  
  
Eventually, the customer comes over, to see what the problem is.  He looks down at the pile of concrete dripping out the broken pipe, prods it with his foot, and asks, ""Where is the fiber we ordered?""  I explain that the buckeye fiber can't be seen after it mixes into the concrete, but assure him that I added it personally.  He then starts yelling at me.  He didn't order buckeye fiber, he ordered plastic fibers.  He pulls out his paperwork, and sure enough, that is what he ordered.  I admit it was a mistake, but also tell him that the fibers he ordered won't work with the pump he is using.  The inspector tries to explain that what he got is as good or better than what he ordered, and he is willing to sign off on the change.  Customer isn't hearing any of it.  We finish the load, and the customer orders another ten yards.  I call it in, adding the bit about the broken pipe and that the customer was upset that the first load had buckeye in it instead of plastic fiber; Bob can hear the guy swearing at me over the radio.  
  
Now Bob tends to be very protective of his drivers.  He is also more than willing to let customers hang themselves with their own lack of knowledge.  I once watched him batch about $1,400 of liquid stupid, because a customer ordered concrete with both an accelerator and a retardant in it.  Bob could have loaded another truck right there and then, and shipped it out.  Instead, he noted that only one truck was scheduled for that job, and waited for me to drive the half-hour back to the plant.  Then he batched the load (with plastic fibers) and brought the ticket down personally.  As he handed me the ticket, he said, ""Don't forget, they ordered at a 4-inch slump.""  
  
Concrete slump is a measure of how wet it is.  It's measured by packing it into a 12-inch tall cone, setting it on the ground, pulling the cone off and checking how far the pile of concrete dropped (slumped).  4-inch is something of a default order, but the only things you pour that dry are footings and curbs, and you don't put it that dry into a trailer pump.  
  
So I load up and drive back to the job.  By now, they have been sitting out there for over an hour in 110-degree heat.  The pumper is panicking, because the concrete is setting inside his pump, and the patch of sidewalk they are doing is going to have a great big cold joint (fresh concrete poured against set concrete makes a weak joint that is more likely to crack) down the middle of it.  As soon as the concrete reaches the back of the drum, the pumper tells me to stop and add a bunch of water.  The inspector authorizes 10 gallons.  It's still dryer than the pumper wants, but the inspector won't allow more.  Then the concrete hits the pump's grate.  Everything is fine for a couple seconds, then it just starts piling up without going through.  All those plastic fibers were getting caught on the grating and clogging it up.  The gravel can't get through with the fiber blocking things up, so all that is getting pumped is cement and water.  
  
Customer comes out furious.  He accuses Bob of spiking the load with extra fiber and tries to reject the load.  I point out that we warned him the load would not be pumpable, and besides that, by having me add water to the load, they have already bought it.  So now we are pumping a few seconds, clearing the grate, then pumping a little more.  It took about three hours (which translated to about $300 of standby charges).  Most of the fiber didn't go through the pump (the pumper didn't want me throwing the giant clots of plastic in his hopper), along with quite a bit of the gravel.  The inspector ended up taking a couple samples from the pump hose (normally they only sample at the truck chute), because he knew what was going into the form wasn't what was coming out of my truck.  A month later, when those extra samples failed their 28-day test, the school had to tear out that sidewalk and redo the whole thing.  This time, they ordered it with buckeye fibers.  
  
TL/DR: Customer started swearing because I accidentally gave him what the job needed instead of what he asked for.  Brought back a second load the way he ordered it, and it made the entire job fail inspection.  Also made a pumper whose poorly maintained equipment nearly injured me stand out in 110 degree heat for several hours.",2962,2018-07-08 15:09:35,MaliciousCompliance,Hippo_Singularity,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/8x1o3n/when_we_say_its_not_pumpable_that_means_it_wont/,/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/8x1o3n/when_we_say_its_not_pumpable_that_means_it_wont/,8x1o3n,I know nothing about concrete but that story was really well-explained.

"Dust, Stars and cosmic rays swirling around Comet 67P/Churyimov-Gerasimenko, captured by the Rosetta probe",,20954,2018-07-08 17:57:08,space,modaladverb,https://v.redd.it/2covqjnq8r811,/r/space/comments/8x2tqe/dust_stars_and_cosmic_rays_swirling_around_comet/,8x2tqe,"This animation is a series of images from the Rosetta spacecraft and features the towering cliffs of the comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko surrounded in what appears to be a snowstorm. Of course, it isn’t a snowstorm. It is largely a combination of star motion in the background and dust and cosmic rays in the foreground. 
Most of the streaks in the foreground are most likely dust particles which are likely part of the comet's coma, a hazy envelope of dust and gas that commonly forms around the comet’s central icy body, also known as nucleus. 
These particles are floating rather far away from Comet 67P and not, as it looks like in the GIF, on the icy world. 
Rosetta captured the images at a distance of 12 km from the comet. At this distance, Rosetta’s OSIRIS camera doesn’t have the sensitivity and resolution to observe dust particles flying around directly above the comet. 
The apparent motion of these particles is largely thanks to the movement of the spacecraft through 67P’s coma and, since the images are compressed into a short GIF, the action appears much faster than how it occurred in real time. 
The dust was of high scientific interest. Three of Rosetta’s instruments studied these dust grains by analysing their composition, mass, momentum and velocity, and profiling their 3D structure. Studying the smallest and the most pristine grains is helping scientists to understand the building blocks of comets.
The motion of the stars is the result of a combination of Rosetta’s changing position as it takes images and the comet’s rotating motion.
The stars from the constellation Canis Major are on the right side of the GIF and the stars of the cluster NGC 2362 are in the upper-left hand corner of the images. 
ESA‘s Rosetta Mission is the first mission in history to rendezvous with a comet and escorts it as it orbits the sun. 
These missions help us to learn more about the „time capsules“ of our solar system, the evolution of our solar system and the role comets may have played in the formation of planets.
The mission also showed us how a comet changes as it is subjected to the increasing intensity of the sun's radiation when it enters the inner solar system and it sent valuable scientific data of the comet. 
The effects of solar radiation and solar winds, trigger an effect called outgassing. Here, frozen or absorbed gas is released. 
The released gas carries dust away with it. This dust forms an extremely tenuous atmosphere around the comet called ""coma"". The Sun's radiation pressure and solar winds cause a tail to form, which points away from the Sun. The comets gas and dust form a separate tail. 
The tail made of dust is visible because it reflects sunlight, the tail made of gases glow from ionisation.
Comets are made of material left over from the epoch when our solar system formed, about 4.6 billion years ago due to the gravitational collapse of a molecular cloud. A comet's nucleus is made of rock, dust, ice and frozen gases such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, ammonia and a variety of organic compounds. 
Rosetta is the first spacecraft to witness at close proximity how a comet changes as it is subjected to the increasing intensity of the sun's radiation. The observations will help scientists learn more about the origin and evolution of our solar system and the role comets may have played in the formation of planets.
To create this GIF, the images have been rotated by 90 degrees. Without this rotation, the „snow stars“ would move sideways.",CA[deleted],4196,2018-07-08 15:39:16

Sometimes after school I came over to play Atari and even stayed for dinner. I'd ask the dad  about Vietnam, but living his entire life in a country mired in conflict, it was hard to avoid talking about the war. 

I once asked him how he felt about America leaving. He said it was one of the saddest days of his life. It was that moment he knew the war was lost, that it was only a matter of time before the North would roll through Saigon's streets in their tanks. Of course he was right, and he barely escaped the country with his wife shortly thereafter. 

While this gif is a happy moment for American GIs, there was a great cost. He certainly didn't harbor any grudges toward America for leaving--he was grateful they fought with them for as long as they did--but he did occasionally wonder with great regret what Vietnam could have been like had the Americans stayed for just a little longer. Then again, he would always add, perhaps there would still be fighting and no Vietnam left. 

He was a wise man and I miss his stories. Plus, his wife's pho was fucking delicious. ",CA[deleted],1051,2018-07-08 15:41:50
