/r/Politics is looking for more moderators!,"#Hello /r/politics users! 

As you may be aware, this subreddit recently reached a milestone when we passed the 4,000,000 user mark. This is an incredibly active subreddit, and that is and has always been evidenced by a very large amount of user reports, and it can be a challenge to address reports on comments and submissions in addition to everything else we have going on such as AMA's, Modmail, Megathreads, etc.

We have always had a [link in our sidebar](https://politicsmodapp.herokuapp.com/) where users can apply to be a moderator, but the truth is we don't get many applications at all, so we have decided to reach out to users on a larger scale. 

#Who are we looking for?

We are looking for users that have a significant amount of time to contribute to moderating. This is a highly active subreddit with a large volume of reports, if you can only be available a few hours a week when things need doing, this is not the position for you.

We are looking for users who want to be here and will put in the time to learn the ropes. Especially in the beginning, it's a large investment of time and patience to learn our rules and procedures. If you think you can't commit to that, this is not the position for you.

Everyone has opinions, but we strive for impartiality, we will not tolerate biased decision-making. This is not your soapbox, all mods are expected to leave their opinions at the door. If you don't think you can do that, this is not the position for you. We will be reviewing your work and anyone who does not adhere to this will have all permissions revoked immediately and will be removed from their position. 

We expect a history of civil behavior in our subreddit. It's imperative that we know if given the chance to engage with the subreddit and users in an official capacity you will do so in accordance with our rules. 

This of course doesn't represent the entirety of what we are looking for, but if you believe you fit the above criteria we will absolutely review your application! We will remove this sticky when we believe we have enough applicants to move forward with, and we thank you in advance for your applications.

Discussion Megathread: Final Senate Confirmation Vote On Brett Kavanaugh,"The Senate is slated to take its final vote on the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh later on Saturday, and barring any changes in senators' publicly announced decisions, he’s expected to be confirmed.

President Trump's nomination of Kavanaugh in July has been followed by nearly three months of controversy, a pair of confirmation hearings that consumed Washington — one that examined his judicial thinking, and the other in which the nominee denied allegations involving sexual misconduct by several different women — and two weeks of large-scale protests against the nomination that have swept Capitol Hill. The final vote, which requires a simple majority, comes exactly a month before Election Day.
	
The vote will come at the end of the 30-hour period that began on Friday at 10:52 a.m. EDT. The vote is expected to be taken sometime between 4:45 p.m. and 5 p.m. EDT. 
	
Cable news networks and network channels will be broadcasting the Senate vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination. You can also [watch the vote on C-SPAN 2.](https://www.c-span.org/networks/?channel=c-span-2) You can watch the Senate livestream by clicking [here.](https://livestream.com/fednet/senate)",1426,2018-10-06 18:49:55,politics,PoliticsModeratorBot,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/9lxw3t/discussion_megathread_final_senate_confirmation/,/r/politics/comments/9lxw3t/discussion_megathread_final_senate_confirmation/,9lxw3t,I haven't seen this kind of troll critical mass since before 2016.,CA[deleted],1,2018-10-06 17:59:29

We are BuzzFeed News investigative reporters tracking suspicious payments to Trump associates. Ask Us Anything.,"I am Anthony Cormier, an investigative reporter from BuzzFeed News. For the past year, my partner, Jason Leopold, and I have been tracking suspicious bank transactions to and from those in President Trump's orbit. We reported on [Paul Manafort's financial activity](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/fbi-probe-of-paul-manafort-focuses-on-13-suspicious-wire) the day before his indictment, investigated [unusual](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/secret-finding-60-russian-payments-to-finance-election) [transfers](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/newly-uncovered-russian-payments-are-a-focus-of-election) at the Russian embassy, discovered cash transactions by a [GOP operative](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/peter-w-smith-hillary-clinton-emails-trump-flynn-money), and reported on the financial web linked to an accused [Russian agent](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/maria-butina-paul-erickson-suspicious-bank-money-russia). More recently, we published two stories on a string of transactions shortly [before](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/anthonycormier/mueller-investigation-money-trump-tower-meeting) and [after](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/anthonycormier/trump-tower-meeting-suspicious-transactions-agalarov) the notorious Trump Tower meeting in June 2016 — which are now part of the wide-ranging Mueller inquiry. Ask us anything! 

We'll start answering questions at 2pm ET.

EDIT:

After five hours, we are wrapping things up. Thank you so much for all of these great questions. Future updates to our [Money Trail series will be posted here](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/collection/themoneytrail). Follow BuzzFeed News on social media for the latest and check out [this page](https://support.buzzfeednews.com/) for other ways to support our reporting.",3934,2018-10-05 18:04:15,politics,buzzfeednews,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/9lo4jp/we_are_buzzfeed_news_investigative_reporters/,/r/politics/comments/9lo4jp/we_are_buzzfeed_news_investigative_reporters/,9lo4jp,"Anthony, on a podcast you did with Ben Wittes at Lawfare on January 17th, 2018 (relating to this story: [""Investigators Are Scrutinizing Newly Uncovered Payments By The Russian Embassy""](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/newly-uncovered-russian-payments-are-a-focus-of-election)) Ben asked you this question: ""*…Do you think there's a specific theory that connects these (payments) with the (core) Russia matter (that Mueller is investigating)?*""

You responded with this fascinating answer: ""*I do and I'm not at liberty to report it right now….there is a working theory as it relates particularly to the Kislyak transactions and the attempted withdrawal of money…that relates directly to the ""core mattter"". They (sources) are hesitant to even remotely broach it on background, let alone on the record. But there are specific lines of inquiry that the special counsel's office, or the people its working with, have taken. We know from really reliable individuals who have first-hand knowledge that they are keen to know about the $150k as it relates to Kislyak's conversations and meetings with administration officials. There's a reason that we're (journalists) interested in meetings (with Kislyak), those are really important. The investigators are beyond due diligence,* ***they have very specific thoughts on what this could have been used for*** *and they are running it down as hard as humanly possible.* ""

So my question is, are you now at liberty to report on what that theory/line of inquiry is, and/or has it already been answered by subsequent reporting?

Thanks, and great work guys!",CA[deleted],171,2018-10-06 18:44:35

Discussion Megathread: Senate Vote On Brett Kavanaugh Confirmation,"With key lawmakers undecided, senators are set to begin voting on whether to advance Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court. The votes comes amid allegations of sexual misconduct and intense protests that have divided the nation.

The first floor vote on Kavanaugh, scheduled for 10:30 a.m., comes one day after Republicans and Democrats reviewed the FBI report detailing interviews about allegations of sexual misconduct leveled against the nominee. Republicans on Friday generally expressed vindication from the report; Democrats voiced disappointment, claiming the scope was insufficient and lacking key information and testimony.",3885,2018-10-05 13:41:16,politics,PoliticsModeratorBot,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/9llx7v/discussion_megathread_senate_vote_on_brett/,/r/politics/comments/9llx7v/discussion_megathread_senate_vote_on_brett/,9llx7v,I think I’ve read every story related to this saga and have no idea what’s going to to happen in the next 48 hours. ,CA[deleted],1075,2018-10-06 19:02:01

New York State is one of 13 states that do not allow early voting.  That's atrocious.  In order to vote on any other date (absentee ballots), you have to attest (under threat of felony) that you won't be in your county on election day at least 32 days before the election (so ballots can be sent to you).  Or if you have an illness or physical disability... or are in jail.  Those are the only reasons for not being able to be at the polling place on election day.

&#x200B;

We need to make voting more accessible in states that do not allow early voting and require an excuse to vote by absentee ballot.  On the list: Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Virginia.

Discussion Thread: Midterm Election Polling | Week of October 16th 2018,"#Introduction

Welcome to the weekly /r/politics discussion thread for polling as it relates to the 2018 U.S. midterm election. The midterm election will take place on November 6, 2018. 36 gubernatorial seats, 35 US senatorial seats (33 regular plus 2 special elections), all 435 voting representatives in the US House of Representatives and part or all of 87 of 99 state legislative chambers (Nebraska is the only state that has a unicameral legislature) will be up for election. The past 3 midterm elections have been ""wave"" elections where the party not controlling the White House has won at least one House of Congress, and Democrats hope to turn President Trump's first midterm election into a referendum against his policies.  

As we get closer to the election, polling will become more frequent, and race prognosticators will get bolder in predicting outcomes. Below are a selection of race prognosticators and polling aggregators, spanning the ideological spectrum (although generally fairly accurate). Please feel free to discuss current polling, predictions and everything else midterm election-related in this thread. As always, please be mindful of our [commenting guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/index#wiki_be_civil) when posting.

#Race Predictions

Race prognosticators are folks who make predictions as to the outcome of the election, and assign rankings for individual races. The most frequently cited (and organizations with most reputation) are the following:

* **Cook Political Reports**: [Governor](https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/governor-race-ratings) | [Senate](https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings) | [House](https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/house-race-ratings)

* **Larry Sabato's Crystal Ball**: [Governor](http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/2018-governor/) | [Senate](http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/2018-senate/) | [House](http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/2018-house/)

* **Inside Elections***: [Governor](https://insideelections.com/ratings/governor) | [Senate](https://insideelections.com/ratings/senate) | [House](https://insideelections.com/ratings/house)

^(*Inside Elections carries on from Stu Rothenberg's Rothenberg Reports.)

In each case, the above prognosticators are known for having connections with both parties who are willing to divulge party insider information, and have staked out a reputation from prior predictions for being accurate. 

Next are a number of either recent, or partisan-leaning prognosticators that have also been cited:

* **FiveThirtyEight/ABC**: [House](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/house/) | [Senate](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/senate/) (quant model)

* **CNN Politics**: [Senate](https://www.cnn.com/election/2018/key-races/senate/seat) | [House](https://www.cnn.com/election/2018/key-races/house/seat)

* **Real Clear Politics (R-lean)**: [Governor](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2018/governor/2018_elections_governor_map.html) | [Senate](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2018/senate/2018_elections_senate_map.html) | [House](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2018/house/2018_elections_house_map.html)

* **Daily Kos Elections (D)**: [Governor](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2018/6/4/1769407/-Daily-Kos-Elections-2018-race-ratings#gubernatorial) | [Senate](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2018/6/4/1769407/-Daily-Kos-Elections-2018-race-ratings#senate) | [House](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2018/6/4/1769407/-Daily-Kos-Elections-2018-race-ratings#house)

* **RRH Elections (R)**: [Governor | Senate | House | Row Officer](https://rrhelections.com/index.php/rrh-elections-race-rankings/)

* **POLITICO**: [Governor | Senate | House](https://www.politico.com/election-results/2018/house-senate-race-ratings-and-predictions/)

##Rating Explanations:

* *Solid/Safe:* Seat is not expected to change hands in the election.

* *Likely:* Seat is unlikely to change hands, although is ""on the board"". A seat being rated ""Likely"" at the moment could also presage further shifts to more vulnerable categories later in the election. Generally, these are imagined as expecting one party to win by high single digits/double digits.

* *Lean:* One party is likely to win, but it is not a surefire bet. In past races, candidates rated ""Lean"" have gone on to win about 70-80% of the time. Generally, these are imagined as expecting one party to win by mid to high single digits. 

* *Tilt:* Only a few prognosticators use this category. It generally means ""Tossup"", but one side is likely favored by low to mid single digits. 

* *Tossup:* Neither party is a favorite to win. In the past, about 40-60% of the time, the seat flips to the other party, accounting for certain factors in play (for instance, whether it is a ""perennial"" vulnerable seat, where a politician is better at appealing across the aisle and surviving). Generally, these are imagined as expecting the ultimate spread to be low single digits for either party.

"I’m Anna Kaplan, Democratic candidate for the New York State Senate’s 7th District. My race is the one experts have picked as most likely to flip the New York Senate to Democratic control, Ask Me Anything!","Hello reddit! I’m Anna Kaplan. I’m a two-term North Hempstead Town Councilwoman and I’m the Democratic candidate running for the New York State Senate’s 7th District here on Long Island. I’m a former political refugee who arrived in this country alone at age 13 after fleeing Iran’s Islamic revolution and I lived in foster care for almost two years waiting for my parents to be granted legal entry into the U.S. I was granted political asylum and eventually, U.S. citizenship.

I’m a social liberal who has backed the fight for $15 minimum wage and paid family leave but I’m also a fiscal conservative who has worked across party lines to help North Hempstead achieve an AAA bond rating (the highest rating possible) and to keep Town taxes the lowest on Long Island.

I’m facing a pro-gun, anti-choice, one-term Republican incumbent in a district that voted for Hillary Clinton by almost 13 points. I’ve been endorsed by both the Democratic establishment and the progressive wings of the party. I’ve also been endorsed by former President Obama. Although my opponent will outraise me with millions of dollars from charter school-backing hedge fund billionaires and New York City real estate interests, I have an army of grassroots supporters who have been knocking doors and making calls to deliver victory in November.

Republicans currently have a one-seat majority in the New York Senate. Since I announced my candidacy in April, experts have picked me to be the candidate most likely to unseat a Republican and flip the New York Senate to Democratic control. Let’s do this!
