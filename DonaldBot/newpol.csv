Discussion Megathread: Final Senate Confirmation Vote On Brett Kavanaugh,"The Senate is slated to take its final vote on the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh later on Saturday, and barring any changes in senators' publicly announced decisions, he’s expected to be confirmed.

President Trump's nomination of Kavanaugh in July has been followed by nearly three months of controversy, a pair of confirmation hearings that consumed Washington — one that examined his judicial thinking, and the other in which the nominee denied allegations involving sexual misconduct by several different women — and two weeks of large-scale protests against the nomination that have swept Capitol Hill. The final vote, which requires a simple majority, comes exactly a month before Election Day.
	
The vote will come at the end of the 30-hour period that began on Friday at 10:52 a.m. EDT. The vote is expected to be taken sometime between 4:45 p.m. and 5 p.m. EDT. 
	
Cable news networks and network channels will be broadcasting the Senate vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination. You can also [watch the vote on C-SPAN 2.](https://www.c-span.org/networks/?channel=c-span-2) You can watch the Senate livestream by clicking [here.](https://livestream.com/fednet/senate)",1438,2018-10-06 18:49:55,politics,PoliticsModeratorBot,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/9lxw3t/discussion_megathread_final_senate_confirmation/,/r/politics/comments/9lxw3t/discussion_megathread_final_senate_confirmation/,9lxw3t,I haven't seen this kind of troll critical mass since before 2016.,CA[deleted],1,2018-10-06 18:01:38

We are BuzzFeed News investigative reporters tracking suspicious payments to Trump associates. Ask Us Anything.,"I am Anthony Cormier, an investigative reporter from BuzzFeed News. For the past year, my partner, Jason Leopold, and I have been tracking suspicious bank transactions to and from those in President Trump's orbit. We reported on [Paul Manafort's financial activity](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/fbi-probe-of-paul-manafort-focuses-on-13-suspicious-wire) the day before his indictment, investigated [unusual](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/secret-finding-60-russian-payments-to-finance-election) [transfers](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/newly-uncovered-russian-payments-are-a-focus-of-election) at the Russian embassy, discovered cash transactions by a [GOP operative](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/peter-w-smith-hillary-clinton-emails-trump-flynn-money), and reported on the financial web linked to an accused [Russian agent](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/maria-butina-paul-erickson-suspicious-bank-money-russia). More recently, we published two stories on a string of transactions shortly [before](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/anthonycormier/mueller-investigation-money-trump-tower-meeting) and [after](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/anthonycormier/trump-tower-meeting-suspicious-transactions-agalarov) the notorious Trump Tower meeting in June 2016 — which are now part of the wide-ranging Mueller inquiry. Ask us anything! 

We'll start answering questions at 2pm ET.

EDIT:

After five hours, we are wrapping things up. Thank you so much for all of these great questions. Future updates to our [Money Trail series will be posted here](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/collection/themoneytrail).

You responded with this fascinating answer: ""*I do and I'm not at liberty to report it right now….there is a working theory as it relates particularly to the Kislyak transactions and the attempted withdrawal of money…that relates directly to the ""core mattter"". They (sources) are hesitant to even remotely broach it on background, let alone on the record. But there are specific lines of inquiry that the special counsel's office, or the people its working with, have taken. We know from really reliable individuals who have first-hand knowledge that they are keen to know about the $150k as it relates to Kislyak's conversations and meetings with administration officials. There's a reason that we're (journalists) interested in meetings (with Kislyak), those are really important. The investigators are beyond due diligence,* ***they have very specific thoughts on what this could have been used for*** *and they are running it down as hard as humanly possible.* ""

So my question is, are you now at liberty to report on what that theory/line of inquiry is, and/or has it already been answered by subsequent reporting?

Thanks, and great work guys!",CA[deleted],176,2018-10-06 20:25:45

"Hi, I'm Stacey Abrams. If I win my ""toss up"" Georgia gubernatorial race, I'll be the first Black woman governor in America. Ask Me Anything!","Hi, I'm Stacey Abrams. I'm a tax attorney by trade, a serial entrepreneur, an award-winning author, and the former Democratic Minority Leader in the Georgia House. I am running for governor to build a Georgia where every family has the freedom and opportunity to thrive. If voters put their faith in me, I will be the first Black woman governor in U.S. history. 
 
I like to say I'm Mississippi-raised but Georgia grown. I grew up in a big family (3 sisters, 2 brothers), and we moved to Georgia when both of my parents were called to ministry. I'm a proud alumna of Avondale High School in Dekalb, Spelman College, UT Austin, and Yale Law School. 
 
I believe that poverty is immoral and economically inefficient, and I believe we can use policy to end it. That's why I first ran for public office in 2006, and why I founded an organization to combat voter suppression and help eligible people of color register to vote in Georgia.
 
As the first woman to lead either party in the General Assembly and the first Black person to lead in the House, I worked to elect Democrats and prevent a Republican supermajority. I also stopped legislation to raise taxes on the poor and middle class and to roll back reproductive health care, and worked across the aisle to save the HOPE scholarship. 
 
I will continue that work as governor: Expand Medicaid for 500,000 Georgians, support educational opportunities for every Georgian, and support small businesses to build a thriving economy in all 159 counties.
 
Under the pen name Selena Montgomery, I've written 8 romantic suspense novels and (shameless plug) released my first non-fiction book (Minority Leader: How To Lead From the Outside and Make Real Change) earlier this year. 
 
I'll admit: I'm a pop culture junkie. I watch a lot of TV (right now: Supernatural, The Good Place, Living Single reruns, Leverage), I'm a big fan of Buffy and Star Trek (especially Voyager and TNG), and I'm a voracious reader (Colson Whitehead, Haruki Murakami, Nora Roberts, tax policy, and more).
 
I’m excited to answer your questions, and I’ll be around for about an hour starting at 3:20 PM. Ask me anything!
